            "body": "You can usually catch snags with a needle and thread and pull them to the inner side of the garment (if it\u2019s a thicker sweater, you can tack it down with a couple tiny stitches too). \n\nI try to treat stains right away (I\u2019m at home 99% of the time so I\u2019ll spot clean with soap/water). If it\u2019s still stained, I\u2019ll treat it with a stain remover before throwing it in the wash. \n\nI think some items, like a basic white tee, will eventually get too stained/dingy to wear in public and you might need to replace them on a more frequent basis than black tees for example. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean toss - you can keep them as housewear/pyjamas, or as clothes you don\u2019t mind getting dirty/wrecked for chores/painting/etc. Or cut up and use as cleaning rags (my mom always did this with my dad\u2019s old undershirts).",

I pulled out the Align shorts and they turned out to match the middle one kind of perfectly, so I'm wearing them today as a set \ud83d\ude0d\n\nu/PaulaLoomisArt also asked, so here's the basic process. You need vinegar, powder acid dyes, synthetic sinew, some sort of permeable rack and a basin that's either stainless or you don't care about getting dye on, aluminum foil, and ice. I followed the basic steps on [this Kool-Aid dyeing tutorial](http://www.pburch.net/dyeing/FAQ/drinkmix.shtml), which is essentially how you handle any acid dye project. Then I followed [this tutorial](https://mythicseam.com/geode-dyeing-fabric/) on how to tie it\u2014they're not kidding when they say you need to pull it TIGHT, but I found I was able to do that with just the spool the sinew came on.\n\nYou saturate the fabric in vinegar and tie it up. I have a metal rack thingy that I found in the drawer under my oven (no idea what its original purpose was lol), so I put that across my (stainless steel) sink and put the tied fabric on that. I've been sprinkling the dye directly on the fabric and placing ice over that, but you can also put the ice on first and sprinkle the dye on the ice\u2014I've seen some people even do both. Either way, make sure you don't skimp on the dye; it should look completely solidly covered, unless you want to leave large un-dyed areas. Then you need some way to keep the ice directly on top of the fabric, so I've been surrounding the whole thing with aluminum foil \"walls\" and then filling that with ice. Make sure it's good and covered. Let the ice melt completely. After the ice melts and the dye has been absorbed, you need to cure it with heat; I've been doing the microwave method described in the Kool-Aid link. Let it cool, then rinse out. And that's it!",

All my tops get washed in garment bags to avoid wear in the washing machine. I use a depiller on sweaters. I tease small snags back into line. Any rips or repairs go to the seamstress. If a garment has a blemish I can still notice after treating, it goes to the charity shop. If it's ripped and can't be fixed, it goes into the local textile recycling bins.

Adding baking soda to warm water with Vanish and using a brush to work it into the stain, I learned from some guy on YouTube who did a comparison of different techniques. The garment bag thing, I started doing it on my own (if it's good enough for my lingerie, it's good enough for my tops- you can also launder inside-out, btw). Using a depiller, I probably read it in some magazine years ago. Teasing snags back in, I learned from when too much toothpaste would come out of the tube- I would squeeze the tube and suck it back in, a reverse squeeze, if you will- so I used the same concept for little snags. I tried wearing garments that still had a small blemish after washing, and I was so self-conscious, I couldn't deal, so now I give them away. The fabulous part, that's all me- I always say that I'm too fabulous to wear ratty tatty clothes :)",
