These are all attempts to make my casual, wfh, toddler-minding life cute and fashionable.",

I feel like my feet look so terrible--it could just be winter feet, the angle, they're swollen at the end of the day, but I feel like they look like medical illustrations of a condition! I don't want to be someone who has to \"hide\" part of their body but at this point, I don't even know anymore! \n\nLeaving that aside, I've been trying to set my hair in Velcro rollers every day for a \"90s blow out\" look (if it's not pulled back) and I'm really enjoying the results from that.",
