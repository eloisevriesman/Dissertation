And remember, your kids will soon be old enough for you to safely wear silk and sparkles around them at least some of the time, and in that case, if a more country lifestyle is the concern, you can always throw a smock or sweater over a nicer outfit for chores and/or wear more fun tops with practical bottoms. And replace the ballet flats with boots maybe. \n\nYou could also try leaning into fancy countryside looks, like equestrian inspired, if you're into that.",

As a mom, you don't necessarily have to relent yourself to the T-shirt and leggings uniform!\n\n\nOne of the things I had to come to terms with as a mother is that I have to be comfortable with nice clothes getting washed more often because of kids. Once that was something I got comfortable with, I was able to open myself up to wearing nicer clothes.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can also explore the cut of clothes without sacrificing comfort, such as more athletic fit ballet flats, mock neck or cropped tees or loose linen tops instead of t-shirts, and wide leg jeans instead of straight or skinny. You're still on trend, but don't have to give up comfort or functionality. Plus, investing in making sure your clothes fit properly can make a whirlwind of a difference.",

I always find myself waiting to lose weight before wearing certain styles or outfits, and I'm very conscious of my arms and belly looking flabby. I often feel self-conscious, sticking mostly to joggers and hoodies, with long sleeves. I also think I lack creativity in styling and often end up with ill-fitting clothes. \n\nThis year, I've decided it's time to invest effort, time, and money into changing my wardrobe, but I need the confidence to get there. Can anyone suggest how I can:\n\n1. Find styles that suit my body type?\n2. Build confidence to start wearing new outfits like noodle straps or cropped blouses?\n3. Make better choices when shopping for clothes?\n\nAny tips, resources, or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

Then I make a second board that\u2019s more curated to outfits that I can actually see myself wearing. Whole outfits are great because you can see how other people style and pair their clothing together. And you can also go through and pull out common items - maybe a lot of outfits have a white linen button down, so that would be a good first purchase. \n\nFor figuring out what suits you - go shopping in person to a store/several stores where you can try on a lot of clothes. Try on a lot of things, especially things that you don\u2019t think will work on you (because sometimes you\u2019ll be surprised). Take pictures and notes of what worked, if you tend to do more online shopping, it might also be helpful to take measurements of what fits and what doesn\u2019t. The aim isn\u2019t to buy anything here, it\u2019s research to see what silhouettes and styles you like.\n\nYou can keep refining your pinterest board after that - if you find you prefer slimmer trousers, unpin wide leg trouser fits. Over time you want a curated board that you can use to define your style. \n\nGo slow with more revealing styles, there\u2019s such a huge gap between a hoodie and a crop top. If you buy something and try to bully yourself into wearing it, you\u2019re just going to feel less and less confident. Long sleeve button downs and short sleeve blouses (not cropped) are a great way to start. If you love your new blouses, then maybe take a step for a sleeveless one, or cropped one. You might also find that you don\u2019t enjoy those styles for practical reasons, and that\u2019s totally fine (for example, I\u2019ll never wear anything that shows my belly, because my belly gets cold).",

So if you're self-conscious about your shoulders being too wide, you can balance it out with volume around your hips. If you want to elongate your legs, high-rise pants with hems that drag on the ground will do that. On the other hand, to shorten your legs, low rise and/or cropped pants are good. That type of thing.\n\n\n\n2. I think you just have to accept what your body looks like. No piece of clothing can change your body's shape other than shapewear, you'll look the same whether you're wearing sweatpants and hoodies or a strappy dress. For me personally, what helped with this was leaning heavily into fashion - I focus on making outfits that look cool and trendy, not on outfits that make me look hot or like I'm 10 kg lighter. Maybe something similar could help you too, to think of your body as just a place to put your clothes vs. the entire focus of the outfit.\n\n\n\n3. The best thing to do is to buy stuff slowly. Start with a few pieces you really like, wear them a few times, see how you feel. Making a Pinterest board or people watching and analyzing outfits is not a bad idea either, just to figure out what kind of stuff you like. Consider practicality, like which parts you're comfortable showing, whether a piece of clothing is comfortable, whether it fits into your lifestyle, and especially with pants and skirts, whether you can wear normal underwear under it or have to go for seamless thongs.",

Cocktail is shimmer, sequin, beading, satin, velvet, silk, things like that.

I think a large belt that echoes the shape of a traditional cummerbund could solve any problems AND add polish and intentionality to the outfit.

Or something like [THIS](https://www.amazon.com/YALEMEI-Women-Cute-Elastic-Waist/dp/B07SQX3F43)! Could be a super fun nod to the \"tie\" part of the black tie dress code, since you're not going to be wearing an actual bow tie (I assume).\n\nBut honestly, it's already fabulous as is; I'm only nitpicking because you asked!\n\nAs for styling, I would do some really sleek pointy-toed pumps\u2014you could go black or use this as an opportunity for a pop of color\u2014and metallic jewelry (nothing blingy). I LOVE your locs; I think doing a little bit of a style like [this](https://hairaide.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled-2_0008_IMG_6339.jpg.webp) or [one of these](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/3307399717911101/) (especially #2, 3, or 5!) would help them (again) look intentional and therefore add some polish.",

I'm such a fan of bandannas as accessories. [Handker](https://handkerbandanas.com/) and [Sendero ](https://senderopc.com/collections/bandanas)Provisions both have lovely ones, Handker is more cottagecore/florals and Sendero tends to be true Western. \n\n[Sendero Provisions](https://senderopc.com/collections/womens?page=2) also has some women's wear that is Western influenced. Think denim-on-denim, Western rodeo shirts, etc. You could grab a piece or two or use it as inspo.\n\nJeans and a t-shirt are always acceptable, imo. Boot cut is a farm staple. Add in a flannel in the evening or wrapped around the waist. If you have a specific artist you are going to see or are a fan of I'd say grab one of their merch shirts and wear it. I personally find the ['this is my first rodeo'](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1624466848/vintage-style-my-first-rodeo-western-t?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=this+is+my+first+rodeo&ref=sr_gallery-1-15&pro=1&sts=1&content_source=63566c4110abcd2ac6b631ffe9da061879a53b4b%253A1624466848&organic_search_click=1) shirts funny and would be kinda cool to wear to Nashville. They'd go well with jeans and an old work shirt or flannel on top.\n\nWestern wear shirts like those from [Colores MBoutique](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ColoresMboutique?ref=usf_2020) stand out (maybe in a bad way as a tourist) but are lovely. [Impressions, ](https://www.shopimpressions.com/)and [Jessa Kae](https://jessakae.com/collections/sun-dress) both have dresses (and some other items) that might be what you're looking for. [Vetch and Clover ](https://www.vetchandclover.co.uk/)is more pure cottagecore but can be styled more casually or dressed up. I think they wouldn't arrive on time, though.\n\nOverall, I think just picking up some Western or similar accessories would be the way to go since it seems like your trip is quite close. Bolo ties, handkerchiefs, maybe a  hat from [Neon Dancing Cowboy](https://neondancingcowboy.com/), flannels, and so on. Hope that gives you some ideas!",

My tops are mostly whites (creams, ivorys, sand), black, and browns (beige, tan, chocolate brown, etc.). I have a few colorful tops but will pair those with my white linen skirt and sand linen pants. I'm thinking either basil green, moss green, or forest green but open to other ideas.\n\nHere's a link to the skirt options: [https://www.quince.com/women/silk/silk-skirt?color=basil-green&gender=women&tracker=collection\\_page\\_\\_women%2Fsilk\\_\\_Dresses%20%26%20Skirts\\_\\_1](https://www.quince.com/women/silk/silk-skirt?color=basil-green&gender=women&tracker=collection_page__women%2Fsilk__Dresses%20%26%20Skirts__1)",

I have a skirt from Aritzia in a very similar shade, so I\u2019m biased.\n\nMoss feels the most \u201csummer\u201d vacation to me. It\u2019s more of a soft pastel, and seems to be neutral.\n\nBasil feels like a good middle ground all-season colour because of its warmth and vibrancy.\n\nForest feels a bit more formal with the cooler darker tone, and could be a bit dark for a summer look?\n\nI\u2019m torn! I would suggest - pick the undertone that works best with your wardrobe, both for vacation and your regular wardrobe so you can get more mileage out of it.",

He told me yesterday and 'm sorta freaking out because it's such short notice....  I am honestly not quite sure if it's a masters ceremony or just a regular bachelors or if that even matters but if he wants me to come I want to be ready. But any advice would be great I guess in general my style is more conservative as possible  but I do wear a lot of tennis ao jeans  skirts if that helps I have a few dresses too but there's going to be a lot of people there and he dose come from a  slightly more conservative culture. so any help would be amazing!\n\nAlso I'm not sure if I can ask this here but what would you give someone graduating I have never actually been to a collage ceremony before and I'm very socially awkward with these types of things so what would be appropriate I guess when both me and him know I only have about $70 of my own money in my bank account at the moment...",

A nice dress is fine; think something that you might wear to church. A reasonable neckline, somewhere around knee length, nothing bodycon. Sleeveless is probably fine, although I would suggest having a sweater or jacket that works on top of the dress just in case the venue is air conditioned or you want to cover up further.\n\nAnd you don't have to get him a gift at all if you don't want to\u2014I know people do things differently, but I certainly never got graduation gifts from anyone but my family. A card is fine, maybe something small and personal if you can come up with an affordable idea in time. Usually it's something that marks their transition into a new season of life\u2014so like, for my high school graduation, I got a Tiffany keychain from my aunt (because I would be moving out and going off to college) and my own set of matching luggage (for traveling) from my parents. My grandparents just gave me money. You don't need to stress about it.",

You can be as covered up as feels comfortable; that doesn't inherently mean you'll be underdressed. Showing skin \u2260 dressed up. I suggest you go to Pinterest and check out modest fashion or even hijabi fashion to get some outfit inspiration; fashionable hijabis absolutely slay without showing an inch of skin.\n\nExamples of completely covered outfits that would be perfectly appropriate:\n\nhttps://www.nordstrom.com/s/free-people-perfect-storm-smocked-eyelet-long-sleeve-maxi-dress/7676609\n\nhttps://balticborn.com/products/rebecca-maxi-dress-blue-coral-blossom?variant=41732570710181\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/570690584047613179/ (obviously tie or tuck in the shirt instead of the weird thing the model is doing)\n\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/474x/e7/6d/8e/e76d8eee05122ca8035d800c0a879d84.jpg\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/210543351396862362/\n\nhttps://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/news/g3060/muslim-women-style-fashion/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/C6gMI9NyyIe/\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/1100285752704783777/\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/210543351366976447/\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/30891947438686445/\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/203506476905552765/\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/798826052667276041/\n\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/736x/02/20/57/022057bfe936fceb47b735f710ebad75.jpg\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/388224430397103589/",
