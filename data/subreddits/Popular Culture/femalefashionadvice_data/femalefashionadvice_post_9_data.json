Keeps my pants up and gives a pop of colour at the waist line. \n\nI also have folded bandannas and tied them around my wrist as a bracelet. I've also seen it used as an anklet, although haven't used that before.",

As a bonus it catches sweat and if you're super hot or doing stuff outside all day get the bandana wet and then tie it loosely around your neck. in the summer I don't like the knot being too close to my neck.",
