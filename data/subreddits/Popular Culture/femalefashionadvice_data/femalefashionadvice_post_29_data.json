But at the end of the day, its structure is archaic and was never built to prioritize Earth and its inhabitants. It\u2019s no secret that its \u201csuccess\u201d is still bound to harm, unchecked growth and extraction in so many ways. Although I am choosing to redirect my participation, I remain hopeful that there is potential for positive change. Knowing that there are so many incredible people working towards new systems, technology and legislation, we have a chance at this.\u201d",
