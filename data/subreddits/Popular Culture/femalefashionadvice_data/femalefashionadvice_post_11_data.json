I can keep my nice clothes on if I wear an apron over it when I do such tasks. \n\nA lot of this is trial and error. Something that looks comfy and your style may just not work.

I shop almost exclusively secondhand to be able to afford the clothes I want. Don\u2019t settle for the dupe, you won\u2019t wear it as much as the item you actually want. I have a list of clothing that I want to add to my wardrobe and periodically check The Real Real, Vestaire, and Poshmark for deals. For example, I\u2019ve been searching for a leather blazer/duster for 2 years and still haven\u2019t found one that meets all my criteria. I\u2019ve had plenty of time to consider it now that the leather blazer isn\u2019t as trendy as 2-3 years ago, but my desire to have one hasn\u2019t decreased so it further affirms my future purchase. \n\nBe realistic about the level of care that is required to maintain quality clothing. Nice clothes require handwashing, dry cleaning, de-pilling and other maintenance. If you aren\u2019t willing to do these things, your clothes will wear poorly even if they\u2019re well made. There are workarounds to minimize the amount of work (steaming instead of dry cleaning, wearing an undershirt under sweaters) but you still have to do it. \n\nLife is short, wear your clothes. Don\u2019t save things for special occasions. Train yourself to incorporate the nicer items in your wardrobe into your daily outfits. Mixing high and low gives the fashionable/functional vibe.",

Nothing ever got \u201clived in\u201d that spent a lot of time at the dry cleaner. \n2. Only wear Your Silhouettes. Separate the type of fits your aspirational self longs for from the ones that complement the body you have, and then buy only things in those cuts. That\u2019s the easiest way to make sure your clothes are compatible vs competitive and don\u2019t end up wearing you. \n3. List the categories of item you feel are essential to your style. I do this by pretending I\u2019m describing a book character and thinking about how they\u2019d be dressed every day for a week, only it\u2019s me (I have main character syndrome everybody!!!). Pick your perfect thing in each category. Cherish that thing. Wear the shit out of it. Less selection in fewer categories = more wear = more iconic items. \n4. Pick a color palette and stick to it. Having clothes that go with all your other clothes means your entire wardrobe is more wearable on an everyday basis. \n5. Go have some adventures in your clothes. Book an impulse trip. Rent a convertible. Kiss someone exciting. Stay up too late with a friend. Get weird. Clothes that have memories in them feel more special than clothes that don\u2019t, which is why I never \u201csave\u201d my good clothes. Always wear them on any day where something interesting might happen so that they can be imbued with the fire of your lived experience. In fact, I think wearing them often puts you in the right mindset to *make* something interesting happen for yourself, and then the outfit gets to carry that forever.",
