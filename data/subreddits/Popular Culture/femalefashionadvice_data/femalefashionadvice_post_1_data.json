            "body": "Not Japanese but I've lived in Japan for over a decade, and here's some I learned: \n\n-sunglasses are iffy outside of a beach/sports context because covering the eyes was associated with organized and petty crime. PSA posters about scams at ATMs still often show illustrations with the perps wearing sunglasses and evil grins. Pretty sure most people don't think someone on the street wearing fashionable sunnies is a criminal, but it looks \"cool but only on tall foreigners or celebs, not for lil old me\" so they're not a common accessory and most use hats or parasols for sun protection instead. Nowadays also connected with FX+crypto bros/YouTubers who hide their identity (there was a whole trend on insta just before the pandemic of shady influencers promoting MLMs using pics of poses on luxury hotel beds with sunglasses and huge stacks of cash lmao) and it's also considered a bit rude to talk to someone while wearing them. Most visually impaired people I see out and about don't wear them either. \n\n-same with tattoos, also historically associated with crime unfortunately, places with communal nakedness (hot springs, pools, gyms) and most workplaces still often have rules against them. Hanging up a poster prohibiting entry of people with tattoos was just a way for businesses to show they're not run by organized crime, but even today if someone mentions it, it forces staff to enforce the rule sometimes. Best to just cover up and don't ask don't tell lol. \n\n-cleavage isn't a neutral body part or something you walk around showing in the daytime for free lol. Growing up in the U.S. I remember it was so normal for ladies of any age with a v-neck top (not talking like cakes on a plate pushed up to the high heavens with a bandage top, I mean as something unsexualized that just happens when some people wear a v-neck blouse). But here cleavage always has sexual connotations and is something men pay money to see in adult entertainment lol.",

I have worked at several large, international offices, and some of the managers might wear suits or other semi-business formal wear, but most people lean wayyy more casual. Jeans, t-shirts, sweatshirts, sneakers, those are all common. Even if there is a dress code, it's rarely strict on suits and stuff, more like \"don't wear flip flops, and wash your hair occasionally\". The things I wear to work (again, large international company, office work) is what Americans would probably consider extremely casual, sometimes maybe even unprofessional. Of course if you work someplace where you often have to look very professional in the eyes of a client (like a attorney or accountant) there might be different expectations, but I know very few people who have to dress based on a client's expectation. \n\nI always have to hold back when people in this sub ask \"is this appropriate for office work\" because, yeah... Most clothes are appropriate for office work in my (casual Danish) opinion lol.",

You probably have more than one of each.  I've been hunting for cowboy boots I like just to wear for fashion, and when I find them I'll be one of those people at events wearing them lol.

Especially the denim maxi skirt thing (???????) aren't those on trend right now?\u00a0 If I had to come up with a few more for US it would be loose, patchwork cotton jumpsuits tend to fare more hippy/boho, and Patagonia being associated with hikers. But it feels so weird to label a person based on the clothing that they wear. Isn't that what we want to get away from? We are much more than our clothes. Like I've worn modest black and white outfits, it would be strange if someone assumed I was Jewish? Lol",
