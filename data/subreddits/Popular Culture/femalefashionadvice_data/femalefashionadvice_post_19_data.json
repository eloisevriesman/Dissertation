(Got good advice yesterday on shoes - bought sambas and Veja Venturi - and now I'm moving on to bags!!)  Btw not talking like designer bags here (although I'd love to) but just like a standard every day run-around bag.",

                    "body": "I still see a lot of the fanny pack cross body thing, probably most specifically the lulu lemon cross-body. I also see a lot of bags like Uniqlo\u2019s [round mini shoulder bag](https://www.uniqlo.com/eu/en/product/round-mini-shoulder-bag-464484.html) worn across the body. This [Madewell](https://www.madewell.com/the-essential-sling-crossbody-bag-in-leather-NQ285.html) one is a similar shape but leather, if you want more polish. Caveat that I am also a millennial, but I personally think the cross body fanny pack could be on its way out, but general cross body bags will be in for awhile.\n\nEdit- I actually meant to link[this one](https://www.madewell.com/the-sling-crossbody-bag-in-leather-NN848.html) from Madewell as being more similar to the Uniqlo.",

                    "body": "Oh man I'm sorry. \n\nIt might help to isolate the steps and moments where you feel upset and name the emotion. So for example: \n\nBrowsing, picking something, putting in cart, buying, unboxing, styling, wearing, washing/care and then upkeep. Which steps, if any, give you that feeling? \n\nOr is it more generalized, like around fast fashion and climate change? Recently I went on a hunt for vintage Donna Karan runway or RTW Collection pieces and I had this sickening, gut churning feeling realizing that at one point there were hundreds, maybe thousands of each item out there on shelves and racks and in closets and now they are impossible to find second-hand. Which means either they're still in collections (best possible outcome) or in landfills--gone but not gone. The idea of thousands of garments that cost 3 figures each in the 90s rotting away gives me vertigo. And that's ONE brand. I also get that same vertigo when I see hundreds of name-brands I've never heard of in the thrift store. Like...where's the rest of it? Rotting away somewhere. Again, best case it's rotting back into the earth! \n\nA third might be (and this is me especially as I get older) the dreams and fantasy self is gone or slipping away and I don't love the reality that's replaced it. I've sold 90% of my chic, flattering, upscale work outfits. I don't work in an office anymore and likely won't for some time. And even if I do, the office culture is such now that pencil skirts and heels don't make sense. I used to go out a lot more and my health thanks me for not doing that, but the days of costume parties and art gallery crawls and going to see someone's play, and bar hopping and club hopping are over. I don't need cocktail dresses pretty much at all--very, very occasionally if then. \n\nReading that I realize I may not be helping and I'm sorry! But it might help to pinpoint the cause of the anxiety. For me, I used that anxiety to reel in my shopping/spending, focus on secondhand pieces almost exclusively, shop natural fibers, and keep track of my outfits and wardrobe more tightly so I can track what I actually wear vs. my fantasy life. \n\nLeaving all that aside, when you sell something and don't make back your money, it's okay. The cost was learning that you don't like it, that it doesn't work, or that it does't fit in your life. And think of how excited someone's going to be to come across it at a bargain price!",

This is a very pronounced feeling in jeans specifically, and if you\u2019re not used to it can be incredibly irritating. (For a lot of people, over time, the denim will rub away in the thighs - both men and women.) This may be part of what\u2019s causing any crotch discomfort as well.",
