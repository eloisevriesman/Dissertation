But I think they were one of their most popular styles, and they DO make stuff in small batches that sell out fast, so they may be back. I've just never seen them completely gone in every color and size. Anyway, I'm posting despite that because they truly are awesome, they can be found secondhand, and you can always sign up for emails to get new stock alerts if you really happen to like them. \n\n[Here's a link](https://curatorsf.treet.co/l/6538471c-c90a-466c-8549-19531a6f8d4d) with some original model photos. It's not exactly a unique style, so I'm sure you can also find similar elsewhere. They're super flattering and incredibly comfortable. The fabric on these in particular is breathable, but substantial enough to move nicely and not really wrinkle. I basically lived in the black ones last summer and wore the rust-colored ones around once a week also. The black are also on my go-to packing list for travel, depending on weather.",

A beautiful 100% cotton trousers. Compared to other natural fabrics, cotton is the cheapest option but still very breathable (Stefanel)\n2. Linen is the go-to choice for summer. The only downside is it will wrinkle as soon as you sit on it. But every linen piece I ever owned held together very well (Stefanel)\n3. I know those are jeans but sometimes I need something that\u2019s not as delicate as the other 3 ones. A lighter color will be better for light reflection\n4. This is by far my favorite. Being made of silk you will forget you are wearing something. But out of all of those you need to be super careful with silk trousers (Maliparmi)\n\nIn general, I would try to buy something lighter colored and something with a loose fit, because the air circulation is improved a lot by this",
