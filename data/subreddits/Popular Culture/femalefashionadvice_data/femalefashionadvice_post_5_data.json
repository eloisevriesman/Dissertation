I run COLD and am shocked by how much use I've gotten out of my sweaters in Texas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0When I took the bus, I would wear a UPF button-up over my shirt and swap it for the sweater at the office. I just accepted the sweat on the walk to and from the bus, plus the UPF shirt also helped reduce the intensity of the bus air conditioning. \ud83e\udee0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0I think it's important to know how you respond to different temperatures personally and also whether your climate is hot and humid or just hot. For me the main issue on my commute was the intensity of the sun, especially since I burn very easily, which is why the UPF shirt worked. If it had also been humid, I would have needed much breezier/looser clothes to not drown in sweat.\n\n\nI don't understand how people can wear summer dresses to the office here! I would be so cold and miserable with nothing on my legs. Some people do it though. Outside of the office, my trick for not freezing inside when I wear shorts is to wear shoes with socks, not sandals, so maybe that could help make dresses tolerable indoors too.\u00a0",
