I'm looking to buy another pair of Everlane Tall pants in a different style, probably denim. Any suggestions - what else has fit you well?",

I would go with hoop/thick earrings (either wood or gold), and a big ring on one hand. I probably wouldn't do bracelets, because of the sleeve detail. If you are going to do a necklace, it would have to be bold, so that it won't be lost in the print, or a large pendant in a solid color. Gold or beige sandals. I wouldn't wear it with black, because it would weigh the whole outfit down. I need to define my waist or else I look like a potato, so I would add a belt, either beige, raffia, woven camel colored leather, or the same color as the shoes.",

            "body": "Thanks to the people who suggested some sneaker options in response to my request in yesterday\u2019s thread. I think I have an evolved idea of what I want: **court-style sneakers** that are **wide**, **comfortable** and **colorful** (or able to be DIY colored/illustrated). \n\nWhile I respect a lot of cool sneakers out there, I\u2019m no sneakerhead, and more subtle branding is preferable. I\u2019ve got a few options below that I like aesthetically; what I need to know is relatively how wide these run (none of them are officially a \u201cwide width\u201d) and how comfortable they are for wearing for hours on end (think dancing at a club or walking a museum), as I can\u2019t find them in stores near me, and I\u2019m getting weary of the buy-try-return-because-it-doesn\u2019t-fit process. For size reference, I wear an EU36 Wide in Birkenstock sandals.\u00a0\n\n- [Saucony Jazz Court Pride](https://www.saucony.com/en/jazz-court-pride/59060U.html?dwvar_59060U_color=S70804-1): I kind of love these? They\u2019re almost campy, but I think I could dig them. Even the non-Pride version seems like a viable option, as I hear Saucony runs wide.\u00a0\n\n- [Adidas Superstar](https://www.adidas.com/us/superstar-shoes/FV3284.html): I\u2019ve heard these also run wide. I would likely get the all-white edition, then make them colorful myself.\u00a0\n\n- [Allbirds Couriers](https://www.allbirds.com/products/womens-couriers-dark-grey-natural-black-natural-white-sole?price-tiers=msrp): These are perhaps the most boring options, but I\u2019ve also had moderate success with Allbirds comfort for my feet.\u00a0\n\n- [Gola Tennis Mark Cox](https://www.golausa.com/womens-gola-classics-c15/tennis-mark-cox-c156/vegan-gola-classics-womens-tennis-mark-cox-rainbow-ii-sneakers-p2035): I\u2019ve heard of Gola but don\u2019t see them around my area much. Some reviews I read said they\u2019re well-cushioned, but the shape of the shoe makes me worried that they\u2019re going to be quite narrow.\u00a0\n\n- [Reebok Club C Double](https://www.zappos.com/p/womens-reebok-lifestyle-club-c-double-chalk-core-black/product/9380326/color/963391): Also not the most colorful. I also worry these are low-volume (I have a high midfoot), but they look potentially wide enough.\u00a0\n\nI have tried Cariuma, Vans, and Converse, and they do not work for me. I\u2019ve also heard of Superga, but not necessarily for comfort, and they appear pretty narrow like the Golas. New Balance isn\u2019t off the table, but their branding is a bit too much for me most of the time. And I\u2019m not keen on the idea of Air Force 1s either.

Fall clothing is made for layering, and the colors, materials, and textures are very different than bright, light, breezy summer stuff. If you're \"confused\" about why you can't find items to transition from fall to summer it's because they don't exist pretty much! I guess you could grab a bias cut midi skirt and pair it with a sleeveless top in summer and a sweater + boots in winter but that's a big step up from Converse and jeans or flared leggings. \n\nGenerally speaking, start with a slightly nicer version of what you have or the \"summer version\" for summer.

She has struggled with plantar fasciitis and some chronic ankle pain from a bad sprain.\n\nShe walks half a mile to work and she is usually walking around a lot at work, so her shoes need to be comfortable on the go. Her sense of style is typically quirky: colorful jumpsuits, colorful chunky accessories, denim jacket adorned with enamel pins, chunky glittery boots, etc. For style reference, we live in Northern California. She tones it down for work - usually darker colors, blouses, slacks, the occasional oversized sweater - but she still has a unique style. She leans heavily into Madewell for work clothes.\n\nShe is currently overwhelmed with work and health issues recently, so I'm just trying to take something off her plate. I showed her a couple of shoe styles and she OK'd the general chucky loafer style and I've been finding some interesting styles and options in terms of comfort-oriented shoes.\n\nSince I don't keep my eye on women's fashion, I wanted to get opinion from this forum. Any thoughts on these in terms of fashion trends and/or comfort? New recommendations are also welcome:\n\n1. Top pick right now:\u00a0[ABEO chunky loafer](https://www.thewalkingcompany.com/products/abeo-boulevard-loafer-metatarsal-dark-brown?variant=42878210638001)\u00a0- I was thinking the dark brown color\n2. Not like what she usually wears, but I think she would pull off very well:\u00a0[Bared monkstrap](https://baredfootwear.com/products/coua-black-leather-flat-monks)\n3.

So it's $13 USD both ways. \n\nWatch out for final sale--IMHO it's not marked clearly enough\n\nThey're doing this weird (and I think predatory, frankly) partnership with a service that offers \"final sale UNLESS you spend more and get this return insurance service\". I mean, for a 3-figure item, I guess I can see it. But it gives me the ick. I've seen it on a handful of items and it's unclear which ones and why/how they're eligible. \n\n  \nThe additional % off only works on full price items \n\nI would carefully think through how to use your $25 coupon for signing up for emails/first time customer coupon. \n\nThe biggest issues I've had is not disclosing clearly the condition of shoes or bags (more worn than they appear, but not ultra-dramatically so) and labeling things wrongly. \n\nI just had an unpleasant experience with them that is making me second guess ordering from them again, though, after years of regular orders.. I ordered Dress A. I got Dress B with Dress A SKU tag on it. I took pictures, and initiated a return. I printed out the order, and the wrong-dress listing and wrote a note explaining that the correct SKU tag was attached to the wrong dress, with print outs of Dress A and B. \n\nIt took two weeks after the return reached the warehouse and multiple customer service chats to get a refund. And I had to ask them directly \"I want my entire refund now\" and borderline threaten them with a chargeback to get it. They were giving me the run around about how they were escalating it, and so on. I understand it was confusing and it could appear I was trying to return the wrong item on purpose. But the wrong item was a $1000+ original cost Balenciaga dress and the right one was $130. I mean come on. I could have easily kept the much more expensive item and sold it.",
