I'm seeing the preppy look still doing some florals with a small pattern [a la Liberty](https://www.jcrew.com/r/feature/womens/liberty-loves). I'm also seeing it [via applique](https://www.anthropologie.com/search?q=applique), which is probably my favorite version of it right now. I'm seeing florals most in earrings though, big flowers and blossoms for people who don't want the 80s gold hoop look.",
