Both technically fit but the 28 is a little looser at the waist without being big, so I\u2019m keeping the 28. I would say the 28 fits pretty similar to American Eagle size 6, and Madewell size 4/27. Also I love the short inseam - it\u2019s a perfect full length for my short legs. \ud83d\ude02 For some reason a lot of \u201cstraight leg\u201d cuts end up looking almost like skinnies on me, but this one is a true straight leg cut (it doesn\u2019t taper a lot towards the bottom, just enough so it\u2019s not wide). \n\n[One Teaspoon Low Riders](https://www.revolve.com/mobile/one-teaspoon-low-riders-low-waist-wide-leg-jean-in-black-oak/dp/ONET-WJ218/?d=Womens&itrownum=4&itcurrpage=1&itview=01) - I ordered a size 26 and they fit perfectly at the waist (the size chart on the brand site is accurate for waist measurements, which can differ between fits). Super baggy and comfy. It says they\u2019re low riders, but the rise is actually 10.5\u201d which is firmly mid-rise for me (I suppose you could try to wear them lower on your hips in a bigger size, but I think the next size up would literally fall off of me, and also I hate the drop crotch jeans feeling - there\u2019s just way too much thick fabric.)
