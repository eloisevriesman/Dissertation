I miss that\u2026 it was more possible to give actual helpful feedback, and also I\u2019m just nosy and like to see what other people have in their closets.",

And her outfit was more like \ud83d\ude31 than \ud83d\ude0d.  \n\nIt was supposed to be an outfit for a business meeting, and the skirt she chose was a hole-y knit skirt. A pattern clashing top rolled up to be cropped so the distressing on the skirt would be more visible. I was very confused. And they were like \u201cI am a creative. All of my outfits must showcase my sense of style.\u201d\n\nI was so confused by this outfit. Didn\u2019t feel like it was making a statement in a good way.",

There\u2019s always a backlash of \u201cthat\u2019s so weird/ugly/awful\u201d every time a new trend pops up, until it saturates and becomes popular and then people start liking it more than hating it. \n\nAlso a business meeting for her is going be different than a business meeting in a traditional corporate environment, def not the place to get office wear inspo from.",

This one didn\u2019t have much cohesion.  And to be honest she was also commenting that it may not have been appropriate for the occasion, but she didn\u2019t care.  This wasn\u2019t a matter of not being hip to the trends. Here commentary reflected similar sentiments as she was putting it together.",
