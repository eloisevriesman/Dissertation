I'm 5'5\" and 185 lbs. I hate being hot, but like to travel. I just cannot figure out how to dress in a way that is temperature, age, and weight appropriate. Here's my latest attempt in Mexico. Bad, right? I have trip to southern California coming up and I just want to not hate every picture of myself afterwards. Any ideas?",

And the vertical division is so low, it makes you look shorter. For more flattery, you could try tucking the t shirt and letting it blouse a little over the waist. But whatever you do with this outfit, you are left with jersey fabric and two layers around the torso. Neither is conducive to comfort in hot weather.\n\nMy own gold standard for summer comfort is a loose fitting woven cotton dress. A [sleeveless shift](https://i.etsystatic.com/18318244/r/il/9f05ff/4464579736/il_570xN.4464579736_2n04.jpg) would work well for you. Many outdoors companies make a similar style of easy-care travel dress. If you want to cover your arms, [a shirtdress](https://www.gowholesale.co.uk/images/thumbnails/310/310/detailed/43151/IMG_7253.jpg) in a fine woven fabric would work well - just make sure the fit is loose and the fabric is thin for maximum comfort in the heat. Both of these styles visually de-emphasise the waist area and keep it cool.\n\nFor a practical outdoors activities outfit, I would pick [baggy shorts and a coordinated camp shirt](https://www.toa.st/cdn/shop/files/LTRUS15_2_720x.jpg).  This is a silhouette that prioritises comfort and looks good on nearly any size. To make these shapes more sophisticated, go for linen in neutral shades.",

If your shirt had a pattern or detail, it would come across better.\n\nLinen and tencel/lyocell/rayon are going to be your friends here. I live in a very hot country and the trick to surviving the heat is to wear loose-fitting, breathable clothing. Avoid petro synthetics (tencel/lyocel/rayon are cellulose semi-synthetics, not plastic) as they will make you sweat terribly. Try billowy long skirts, dresses, or wide-leg pants\u2014keep the sun off and keep the breeze moving. Look at what people wear in hot parts of the world. Muumuus and kaftans get a bad rap, but look up traditional Hawaiian muumuus and you might change your mind. Or, go the other way and lean into the Eileen Fisher vibe with light, flowing neutrals.",

I\u2019m looking for a dress that checks a few different boxes, and I was hoping that the hive mind could help me. \ud83e\udd17\n\nI\u2019m (mid-30\u2019s F) going to a wedding in the mountains of Mexico. It\u2019s going to be hot, and it\u2019s going to be a black tie affair. This is my \u201cfancy\u201c side of the family and everyone will be dressed to the nines. \n\nKeeping in mind the hot and slightly humid weather, I also need a dress that will cover my left upper arm to my elbow. The shoulders can be exposed, but my left bicep needs to be covered. So either a one sleeve dress (that covers MY left) or something that will just hide that particular area on both sides.\n\nMoreover, I am only 5\u20193, about 130 pounds and busty (34 DDD). I found some off shoulder dresses that could work, but they have a ton of cleavage and that\u2019s not going to fly around my Mexican family who I haven\u2019t seen in 10 years. Ha ha. *Some* cleavage is totally fine. \n\nAny ideas/links appreciated!! I have dark hair and a tan complexion in the summer so I can get away with a variety of colors. I have a bunch of fun/neutral heel options between my mom and I\u2019s shoe stashes, so no problem there. Thank you!",

No frills on the sleeves, and the skirt was NOT bodycon and draped loosely. It looked similar to this (https://www.amazon.com/Women-Sleeve-Sweetheart-Dress-Stretch/dp/B0CMQQL8T6) but without the slit in the skirt and a looser drape in the skirt. Thinking it might be from one of the athletic brands but I'm not sure.\n\n\n\nI've searched about every search term I can think of, dress cuts (skater, fit and flare, and A-line all qualify I guess), looked on Lululemon/Halara/Alo/Athleta and even Shein/Aliexpress but I can't find this dress.
