Found this cute top at UO but it seems to not fit most body types. I tried to tailor it (gently) to see if I could make it work\n\nIssues I still have with it: size small has little to no fabric to cover boobs, but medium sags and reveals too much around the collar(?) in the middle. It\u2019s like a gaping hole and while I don\u2019t mind wearing something underneath like this picture, it still feels off\n\nHere is a link to how the model looks on the website, and if anyone has time the review pictures say a lot about the poor fitting too [link](https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/kimchi-blue-too-cute-flyaway-babydoll-top?color=010&size=L&type=REGULAR&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=%5BNB%20PLA%20US%5D%20-%20PMAX%20-%20Womens%20-%20Tops&utm_content=&utm_term=&creative=&device=m&matchtype=&network=x&utm_kxconfid=vx6q4l3b6&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADpxK_8ISrJ2M3U8mnsuVAlhHANsM&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxqayBhDFARIsAANWRnSHosN4YaiyyEt1iT3EJWsaSraN-2-Ke91ASnKogsvAO6vQkTXBgToaApiaEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&quantity=1)",
