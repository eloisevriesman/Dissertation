            "body": "Wedding dress codes are a whole mess. I don't think people really understand them regardless. I showed up to a black tie optional wedding recently and people apparently thought the \"optional\" meant \"or whatever you want!\" bc there were people in business casual. \n\nI think the worst dress code is \"come however you feel comfortable\" but they don't really mean it. I'm probably in a disproportionately people pleasing friend group, but I'm like, I need you to make a rule. The weirdest one I've seen recently IRL is \"coastal formal.\" What coast??? \n\nI'd kill to get invited to a maritime boho goth wedding lol. Catch me making a gown out of ancient fishing nets.",

My friend wore a penguin onesie with a cape made out of feathers. (The cape got worn by a lot of people that night.) It was the most eclectically dressed wedding crowd I ever saw.\n\nWorst dress code so far this season: \"Whimsical fancy.\" Ugh. Also have a friend whose parents insist on her wedding being white tie/full evening dress. She's fully aware that most guests are not going to meet that dress code.",

So when you combine all that with the mess of people not bothering to google dress codes before saying it\u2019s what they want for their event makes me *so* stressed out.  \n\nI recently went to a \u201cformal\u201d wedding where the bride and groom actually meant \u201ccocktail\u201d. Fortunately I knew them well enough to know that was likely, but good grief there was every outfit under the sun from casual day dress to floor length, and in enough of a range that seemed disorganized rather than interesting when you looked at the whole crowd at once. \n\nI just find it so frustrating, you google SO much stuff when you\u2019re planning a wedding, why would you not at least check this to give your guests some piece of mind??? It\u2019s just bafflingly bad hosting in a way that makes me nauseous to consider doing to others. \n\nI understand a huge chunk of this is my personal neuroses, but damn bro, words mean stuff, if you aren\u2019t sure, GOOGLE IT",

So they asked a lot of questions and did a lot of googling. People really put the effort in which was so fun.\n\nThere\u2019s obvs some classist stuff wrapped up in dress codes, but personally I love the clarity and opportunity for fun outfits that they provide.\n\nMy solution to dress codes being increasingly meaningless has been to host dress coded parties with friends at our home. We all dress up to the rule/theme, the whole crew gets super into it, and other than the outfits it\u2019s a regular party for people in their mid twenties. Complete with dumb drinking games and too many pets and cheap snacks. It\u2019s a blast, and anyone in this thread who is sad about a lack of fun dressy outfit opportunities should give it a go!",

After so many, my logic is now that it depends on my relationship to the couple. \n\nAre they my best friends and I know their whole family? Then I'm going to go to great lengths to ensure I fit in exactly with what they expect and don't try to outshine anyone. I'll be in pictures, I'll want to be around all night, and I want to be remembered as good company who looked nice. It doesn't mean I dress down, more that I do what I can to help make their day as perfect as possible.\n\nAre they a stranger I've never met or a distant relative? Then I'm breaking out the costume jewelry, furs, sky high heels, and fancy bags. I love going to weddings and seeing that one plus one who looks so much better than everyone else. No one cares, you won't be in any pictures, and it's a great time to experiment with pushing your fancy-pants style boundaries without being too out of place. Usually an aunt or cousin will gush at you in the bathroom about how they love your outfit and you get to say \"No *you* look amazing!\" and everyone feels good.",

DESPERATELY wanted this [Teuta Matoshi dress](https://www.teutamatoshi.com/products/midnight-flaneur-gown) for it but LOL. And I didn't want to buy a dress that I wasn't going to wear so I settled on a very sparkly sequin dress from Rent the Runway.  NGL, I was so excited for the dress code at first, but it's hard finding something that fits galactic but also black tie/not too costume-y!\n\nAlso going to a \"smart casual\" wedding celebration - I say celebration because there are no formal wedding activities, just drinks and light bites. But I have no idea what to wear because of this friend group (my boyfriend's friends) I am consistently over-dressed and the \"high maintenance\" one. I don't want to be fancier than the bride but I'd like to dress up just a little bit!\n\nOP, for \"summer formal\" I'm picturing maxi length, bright colors, but thicker material than a sundress (while not being so heavy as say a winter formal dress).

I get decision paralysis so this takes care of the bulk of decision making.\n\nDesi weddings are a bit chaotic when it comes to dress code. There is always a hierarchy to the level of fancy, where reception is the fanciest. However, all receptions are not equally fancy. And then it depends how big the wedding is, what type of people are there (mostly family vs people you need to impress), if you're a throwaway guest vs a direct member of the wedding family, if the couple is more religious and prefers simpler festivities, if the event is at home or at a venue, etc. So much to consider because it's not as straightforward as \"black tie\" or \"cocktail\".",
