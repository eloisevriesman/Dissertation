The only thing is I\u2019m stumped what to wear with it! My typical style Is more romantic, cottagecore, preppy, coquette, dark academia, etc.\n\nI\u2019m looking around at options and I\u2019m wondering if [this red dress from Poshmark](https://posh.mk/wqtO86iFHJb) would look nice with it? Or do you have any other suggestions?",

The reception will be at an upscale hotel, and the dress code is listed as formal. Does it lean a bit too casual?

Low, thin heels seem to be trending over high and thick heels.\n\n\nMesh flats are a big thing online, but I haven't seen them irl yet (though it's too cold for them here).

For example, the oversized blazer trend; looks great on the tall skinny girlies but oversized blazers on me tend to hit my widest section (thighs) and make me look short and frumpy.  Cropped styles that emphasize my waist are better on me.\n\nAre there any influencers or fashion bloggers with larger bottoms? When I try to search on Instagram, tiktok, Pinterest etc I get a lot of plus sized / curve results which is fine but my body doesn\u2019t quite look like theirs. Or I get really outdated \u201cpear shaped\u201d body results with like 2010s fashion. Tiktok doesn\u2019t even give you results if you type in style/fashion for big butts it thinks you\u2019re trying to search innapropriate content.\n\nIf anyone knows any accounts of petite but curvy gals please link! Preferably chic, trendy but timeless fashion like Scandinavian / euro style but on curvier girls.  I do NOT want BBL fashion which is another search result that pops up when I\u2019m trying to look for fashion inspo for my body type.",

Ideally looking for a basic white shirt to wear in the work place. I'm 5'9, 200lbs, 36DD, athletic hourglass frame (wide shoulders, wide hips) generally wear a 12/14 L/XL. Everything is either see through with a nude bra, fits poorly, or does not wash well. I do not mind paying extra for something that meets all the criteria. The closest thing I have found is the COS Clean Cut T-shirt but they do not currently have my size in stock. Any suggestions that I haven't tried, there has to be something our there :(\n\n  \n**Uniqlo Pima Cotton** - The most recommended, wanted to love it but it was see through and is just not made for my body type. L fit in the body, but was too tight around shoulders/armpits. XL was just too big all around. \n\n**Everlane Cotton Crew** - See through\n\n**Madewell** - I do not shop at Madewell because I have never felt comfortable or welcome in their stores. \n\n**Aritzia** - Not made for my body type \n\n**Abercrombie** - T-shirts aren't breathable and look like shit within 2 washes. \n\n**Old Navy** - Quality just isn't there for something I want to wear in the workplace. Looks ratty after a few washes. \n\n**Gap/Banana** - For some reason they cannot make a t-shirt that isn't that heathered pattern which is see through. Love them otherwise\n\n**Target Brands** - Don't love the quality, see through.\n\n**Universal Standard** - Have one of these already, the fit well/aren't see through but it's too fitted in the chest for me to feel comfortable in the workplace. \n\n**SKIMS Boyfriend Tee** - Collar is too high, fabric is too clingy",

They're over the top pricey but gorgeous fabric. \n\nYou could try Eileen Fisher and Vince but go for the non cotton slub, that's going to be too sheer. \n\nThe thing about white tees is they're underwear, they were designed for men to wear under button down shirts. So when women wear them, it's tough to not be sheer as they're being stretched. The shape isn't typically designed for a bust. Hence why tees tend to look \"effortless\" on the Jean Seburg types and like car wash yard wear on fuller figures. Sadly.",

                    "body": "Okay I actually have some answers for this. \n\n1: CoVid influence. After the WFH and the focus on just surviving this worldwide trauma, many women are much less tolerant of uncomfortable, restrictive clothing. Or performing \"sexy\" or \"flattering\" for either men or other women's approval. They have found hobbies, changed jobs, had kids, moved to the country, started working from home full time, etc. They no longer have a need or desire for fitted, tailored, twee, \"sexy\", \"flattering\" clothes\n\n2: It's a natural extension of the renewed interest in slow clothing, conscious consumption, homesteading/farmsteading, and the cottagecore/dark academia look/trend. Grand Millennial style was trending recently, and it makes total sense to me that coastal grandma, cottage core, and dark academia (and all its sub-niche aesthetics like mushroom girl, fairycore, etc) are all offshoots of that cozy, old-fashioned, and very much unsexy and functional style. \n\n3: It's not just feminine, it's feminine in a way that actively rejects the male gaze. It's hyper feminine--calico, ruffles, big puffy sleeves, voluminous skirts, etc. With the recent political climate (especially in the USA), I suspect women are embracing these hyper-feminine but not sexy/flattering looks as a very subtle f-u to the powers that be and to compulsory heteronormativity/sexism/misogyny. These looks often celebrate a certain type of strong, interesting femininity that is about the past in a way that's not \"1950s nostalgia\". \n\n4: Fashion is cyclical. If you look at fashion trends from the 80s, and then the 50s, you can see there are distinct girlish, hyper-feminine, cottagecore, church-lady dainty feminine looks (ditsy florals, gingham, lace collars, piecrust collars, circle skirts, shirt dresses) trends that echo whatever \"30 years ago\" was for that time period. Fashion is speeding up, so now we're looking at blending 90s grunge influences with a prairie-chic look that echos the \"colonial\" craze of the mid-late 70s and the \"farm/cottage/rural America\" dream of the 80s.",
