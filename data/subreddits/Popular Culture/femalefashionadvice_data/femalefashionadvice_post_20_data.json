            "body": "Ok this is a bit niche but if you want to wear a high ponytail with a baseball cap and can't because of the back, there is this thing called the Ponyback hat with a slit that closes magnetically in the back. They have tons of colors. Also my husband is pretty crafty and just bought me a baseball cap, cut it open and sewed magnets on the sides and it works great!! [https://ponybackhats.com/](https://ponybackhats.com/)\n\nAlso sometimes I just embrace the costumey-ness of it. Love a wide-brimmed sunhat. I like the ones with wire at the brim so you can adjust to a cool little S-shape. I think they work with dresses and jumpsuits just fine in the summer. I also got this hat that is extra wide-brim and it looks like a taco. It's very Jacquemus inspired.\n\nThis is Anya-Taylor Joy at Cannes recently in one: [https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anya-taylor-joy-is-seen-arriving-at-hotel-martinez-ahead-of-news-photo-1715853962.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.880xh;0,0.120xh&resize=1200:\\*](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anya-taylor-joy-is-seen-arriving-at-hotel-martinez-ahead-of-news-photo-1715853962.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.880xh;0,0.120xh&resize=1200:*)\n\nAnd me in my taco hat\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58zxvkit471d1.png?width=1683&format=png&auto=webp&s=bef42f922bce302c153fb128e3694616a43fe1b5\n\nThe ones on the left side of the mirror are my wire-adjustable hats.",

If you put on earrings and a blazer it's very \"cool girl\" but you can also wear it running, near water, etc. because it's not made of cotton. It's thin to keep you from sweating in hot weather. You can put it in a lingerie bag and wash whenever you want.
