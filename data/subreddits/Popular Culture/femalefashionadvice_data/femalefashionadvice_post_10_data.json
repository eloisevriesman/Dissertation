So if I really like a top, for example, I\u2019ll pick it up in black and white; and if I find that I *love* it, I might go back a week later and find it in brown and red. But if it\u2019s available in, say, lime green? No. Orange? No. Loud print? Also no. I know I\u2019ll regret those colors that are harder to match, even if I love the garment itself, so it\u2019s not actually helpful to building outfits for me to have that top in those colors.\n\nSticking to a color palette also means the colors I have for tops match most of my bottoms. Whole wardrobe becomes more mix-and-match when that top in black or pink goes well with both jeans and a black skirt, and I also have the top in white to go with the jeans for a clean look, etc etc..",
