I'm not looking for an effing ankle-duster when I look for a midi dress.\n\n\n* Mini: just-above-the-knee and shorter\n* Midi: knee-length to mid-calf\n* Maxi: longer than mid-calf\n\n\nIt *should* be that simple but it's not and it makes it impossible to consistently sort by length between different retailers.",

                            "body": "Petite/tall/curve fits still exist in dresses so I think it'd be silly to label a dress \"midi\" because it hits mid-calf on the 5'10\" model (who has to buy the \"tall\" fit in basically everything else) while knowing full well that the vast majority of women wearing that dress will be a lot shorter just statistically. And even on tall models, many of these so-called midi dresses hit the top of the ankle (check out Meshki to see what I mean).\n\n\nI liken mini-dresses to shorts, midis to capris/culottes, and maxis to pants. Bermuda shorts are still shorts though they almost hit the knee, and once they go under the knee they become capris/culottes. Then once the capris hit the top of the ankle, they become pants.\n\n\nEdit: just for my own edification I checked out the tallest average height for women on the planet and that honor goes to Latvian women at ~5'7\" on average. Female models, on average, are 5'9\". So designing and labeling dresses based on the average model exceeds even the tallest demographic of women by two inches which is a significant change in fit. Most height averages for women per country are 5'4\"-5'5\" or so. If they're labeling based on where it fits on the model, it makes absolutely no sense to label a dress length based on such a skewed demographic.",

New and just joined - I actually already posted this as a comment on one of the FFAQ posts before I discovered the general discussion thread \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI\u2019m NB (AMAB, raised masc) and used to dress very femme in college, but I didn\u2019t really give a crap if the outfit looked good or not. I just wore what I liked, and it was a small college full of other weirdos so nobody batted an eye.\n\nAfter graduation I started working in a chemistry lab and gradually got rid of everything that would be dangerous (skirts, dresses, loose blouses, heels) or would make it difficult to wear full Tyvek cleanroom gowning (basically the same list), which just left my guy clothes. After 10y as a working chemist all I had in the closet was dockers and men\u2019s shirts.\n\nJust recently I realized that I\u2019ve now been out of the lab for over a decade but haven\u2019t updated my wardrobe at all, so I\u2019m trying to rectify that. I\u2019m no longer shaped very well for the sort of dresses I once wore, but I *love* skirts and tailored blouses (though it\u2019s hard to find the latter that work well on a dad bod) and I\u2019ve been hitting up department and thrift stores to rebuild my wardrobe.\n\nExcept now I\u2019m working in an office rather than hanging out with a gaggle of eccentric scientists, and am discovering that I don\u2019t have a *clue* how to properly coordinate women\u2019s clothing. And when you\u2019re bald and bearded and wearing a skirt and blouse you already stick out, so I have to make *very* sure my outfit helps rather than hurts \ud83d\ude06\n\nLooking forward to reading more!",
