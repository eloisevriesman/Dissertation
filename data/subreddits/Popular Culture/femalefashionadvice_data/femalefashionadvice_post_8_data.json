            "body": "I'm on an endless quest for **comfortable city-type sneakers** to wear to a dance club, concert, the like. On most days my hobbit feet and I get away with [these crunchy Bedrock clogs](https://bedrocksandals.com/collections/bedrock-mountain-clogs) (I love them, 10/10 would recommend for the girlies with wide, high-volume feet) or Blundstones, with sandal Birks occasionally thrown in. But these are all either too heavy for dancing (especially in the summer), or not the right setup for the context (wearing sandals for nightlife is a recipe for gross, painful feet). **Comfort, for me, doesn't mean a lot of arch support or stack height, but it does mean being wide enough, and I need to feel secure enough not to get blisters from jumping around and dancing.**\n\nSome options I've considered:\n\n* I loved the look of [these Vans](https://www.vans.com/en-us/shoes-c00081/together-as-ourselves-sk8-hi-shoe-pvn000cmxcyl), with the paint splatter print, but it's been a long time since I've had Vans, and once they arrived I remembered why I haven't had a pair in a while - they're both too long and too narrow for my feet, despite being a unisex fit. And the sole feels dull, for lack of better word, though if the shape was right I bet that the sole would break in over time.\n* I had [Saucony Jazz sneakers](https://www.saucony.com/en/jazz-original/11843W.html) in college for a brief time, but the way that the sole tapers then flares out didn't work for my feet at all.\n* I had [Birkenstock Bend sneakers](https://www.birkenstock.com/us/bend-low-natural-leather/bendlow-smoothleather-naturalleather-0-rubber-u_2.html) for a restaurant job for a while, and they were alright, but the sole is somewhat stiff, and they never were my favorite.\n* I've tried multiple styles of Hokas, even though they're not quite what I'm looking for, because they're trendy and culturally accepted in my area for all occasions lol. They're just not for me, dawg.\n* I'm considering [Lems Primal Zen](https://www.lemsshoes.com/collections/womens-primal-zen-shoes/products/womens-primal-zen-suede), as I think these are cute and fit my needs on paper, but it's hard to justify that price for something that I worry will break down with not much wear (I've read this can happen with the outsole).\n\nI'd like to keep this purchase **under $100**, with U.S. availability and ideally free exchanges (sizing is my nemesis). My general aesthetic is queer granola artist, but for the right fit and comfort I'm open to a lot of aesthetics. What else should I be considering?\n\nEdit to add: I kind of love these [Allbirds Couriers](https://www.allbirds.com/products/womens-couriers-dark-grey-natural-black-natural-white-sole?price-tiers=msrp&size=6) but I worry about comfort for long days/intense use, and also durability. I have Wool Loungers and those are great for low-walking days, but after walking in them a lot my arches hurt (I think they've stretched significantly over time). I also love the aesthetic of these [Allbirds trail runners](https://www.allbirds.com/products/womens-trail-runners-swt-blizzard-natural-black?price-tiers=msrp%2Ctier-1%2Ctier-2%2Ctier-3%2Ctier-4) but they might be a hair too sporty in their construction for the purposes I need. Has anyone had either of these sneakers for a while and can report back?",

Comfy for all day wear (I used them as a 5mi+ walking, gym, everything shoe), they are lightweight, and they are under $100. You can find them at a lot of different shoe stores too, if you want to try them on before ordering. I went to Nordstrom but they have them all over. \n\nThey also clean really well.

Also if it\u2019s your friends that are hassling you, set boundaries and tell them not to even if they\u2019re trying to do it with good intentions - if they keep doing it, they\u2019re not good friends. Regardless of what you wear, someone somewhere is going to have a shitty opinion about it, so honestly don\u2019t feel pressured to change your style. \n\nIf you do want to make little changes - all black/monochrome outfits look great with bold pops of colour with accessories - like lime green shoes or a red silk scarf or cobalt blue handbag. \n\nIf you want to break into other colours, going for jewel tones or grey/denim/navy/brown/olive are not too far of a step from black. And lighter neutrals like white/light grey/taupe/tan will provide a lot of contrast without being flashy, if you want to try those (I like doing monochrome outfits with one white, mid-grey, and black item). If you like the way black looks near your face, it\u2019s easier to add colour on the bottom as pants/skirt. I wear olive green pants with black tops a lot. \n\nIf you really just like all black, lean into it. I think there are a bunch of old albums for goth/witchy aesthetics in here - if you\u2019re wearing a long black skirt and bell-sleeved sweater with a big silver nature-themed pendant and a darker lip gloss, it looks more intentional.",

I've had no luck with American Eagle's cuts -- I think their curvy offerings have just been atrocious the last few years --  which is the main one I am aware of. I'm not looking to spend a ton, but I'm open to just about anything at this rate.\n\nI used to be a size 10/12 and I never had this issue when I was that size, but now that I'm a 00/0, it feels like smaller sizes are almost cut \"straight\" if that makes sense, like a kid's size? I haven't bought clothing in years because 90%+ of things turn out too big or too small, no matter what size I buy.\n\nWith that being said, if someone has a similar issue and has had luck with non-curvy shorts they think I should try, I'm all ears. I'm mostly looking at denim shorts because I'm a tired human more often than not and like being able to throw on a cropped tee and shorts and go.\n\nThe best fitting shorts I had consistently were American Apparel, but I acknowledge they were far from the perfect fit. This photo is a few years old (from the 2010s, be nice to me Gen Z), but my body hasn't changed much: (edited out) -- I was wearing a 24 here. They were great in the torso; the style was suppose to be a little looser around the thighs, but c'est la vie. (Quick ETA: I know this is quite the look, I got dragged on a hike last minute and was not expecting it, haha).\n\nI think I'm looking for more mom style cut -- fitted in the torso with mild looseness in the thighs -- but am open to anything. Sorry for the essay! I appreciate y'all. I spent a lot of time looking today and just ended up upset and overwhelmed.",

                    "body": "I would approach this from several angles at the same time:\n\n1) Figure out what colours you like/look good in. I suspect you would look great in brighter colours like kelly green, cobalt blue, hot pink etc, but I\u2019m not a colour expert. Honestly the easiest way to figure this out yourself is to go shopping and try on tops in every colour imaginable (even/especially in colours that you think will look terrible on you - sometimes you can be surprised). Take photos for reference. You can build a capsule wardrobe around several \u201cstatement\u201d colours, or just have a couple and mix in more neutral colours, whichever you\u2019d prefer. \n\n2) Start getting more specific about what items/silhouettes you\u2019re looking for. Look for blogs/instagrams/youtube videos of people who have the style you want. Try to find some with a similar body type as you. And it\u2019s an extra bonus if you can find someone in the same general location, because it usually means you\u2019ll easily be able to order from the same shops as them. But don\u2019t worry about all that to begin with, just start with looking for visual inspiration. You can also start a pinterest board and pinning a lot of outfits you like (then later on get more specific and narrow it down to specific silhouettes/colours/and filter out anything that\u2019s not practical or comfortable for your lifestyle). Once you have ideas of what kinds of clothing you\u2019re looking for, go to shops and try on all different types/cuts of clothing. This is where you\u2019ll figure out that you look better in tapered trousers rather than wide, or flowy, less structured blazers rather than really structured ones, etc. You likely have a pretty good idea of this already, but again like the colours, it doesn\u2019t hurt to try on some silhouettes that you naturally don\u2019t gravitate towards, to see if there\u2019s anything new you might want to add. \n\n3) Read blogs/watch videos about building a capsule wardrobe. Identify which pieces you can pull from your current wardrobe, and then create a wishlist of items to fill in the gaps , using the research from the first two steps. This could be really specific or more general, like \u201ca kelly green single breasted blazer\u201d or \u201ca blazer or cardigan in one of my three statement colours\u201d. You can use pinterest to pin ideas for everything all together for an easy scroll through, or make a collage of all the images if you want to be able to see everything without scrolling. \n\n4) Only start looking to buy items after you\u2019ve done the first three steps. It might be time consuming and take longer than you want, but it\u2019s better than buying some things here and there and ending up with an awkward mix of items that end up not being ideal for your dream capsule wardrobe.\n\n5) For jewellery, pick gold or silver (whichever you think looks best on you) and make a little jewellery capsule too. Pick up a watch (Olivia Burton has really gorgeous ones that aren\u2019t super expensive) and anything else that you feel like you\u2019re missing in outfits (maybe a necklace or ring). Don\u2019t invest a whole lot of money into anything, try out the less expensive version first to make sure you\u2019re going to wear it a lot. \n\nFor apps - if you have an iPhone, I use Stylebook mostly to track clothes I own and cost per wear. But one of the features is creating outfits - you could create a \u201cpotential purchases\u201d category, save photos of wishlist items, and then build different outfit combinations in the app (along with your own clothes if you add in your wardrobe). You can also have it generate random outfit combinations, which is sometimes hilarious but would be pretty good for testing out how versatile your capsule would be.",

This gives me a weird shape around my midsection and takes away from my curves. I was hoping someone would know of good shapewear that could pull my apron belly away from my sides to show off my actual figure. \n\nTo avoid any confusion it is an apron belly that physically hangs down due to several previous major weight fluctuations. It\u2019s not loose skin it is my belly. It is also not hip dips or love handles. It\u2019s simply just my tummy so if anyone with a similar issue or any ideas for helpful shapewear could help out that would be much appreciated. Thank you! Preferably something sold online!",

You'll look professional from the waist up, which is enough for being at your desk & on Zoom calls. Also recommend making your hair and makeup really professional and neat. From there you can feel out what to add and subtract to feel like you but also like you fit in at work.
