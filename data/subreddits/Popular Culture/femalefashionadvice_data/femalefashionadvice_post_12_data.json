            "body": "\\*Socks\\*\n\nI recently discovered what was missing in my outfits: socks! and I have realized I have no idea where to start, so I thought about asking here\n\nFirst, which types do you think are a must have?\n\nAlso, which outfits looks best and more important which outfits dont require them? I know this is a weird question, but It has been so long that I have realized that when I think of using socks I think they look akward on me but I think it is just in my head.\n\nMy everyday casual/dont want to think go-to outfits are an example that I cant picture with socks, this is a croped pant/jean or mini skirt with a tshirt tucked in + sneakers, do you think this looks good with socks? and if they do, which kind?\n\nthanks in advance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pantg7rgdr1d1.jpeg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=436099bb2ac39173ade56d78886d4c84f62bb0ac",

One small thing - I think they would be better if they were a tiny bit shorter, just half an inch or so. At the moment they are slightly longer than a classic ankle length. I do think you're right to be concerned about pant length when you're on the shorter side, as overlong pants can make you look even shorter. If you want to try out a longer style, I'd go for a slightly looser and wider classic trouser cut.",

            "body": "Hey ladies! I\u2019m looking for a dress that checks a few different boxes, and I was hoping that the hive mind could help me. \ud83e\udd17\n\nI\u2019m (mid-30\u2019s F) going to a wedding in the mountains of Mexico. It\u2019s going to be hot, and it\u2019s going to be a black tie affair. This is my \u201cfancy\u201c side of the family and everyone will be dressed to the nines.\n\nKeeping in mind the hot and slightly humid weather, I also need a dress that will cover my left upper arm to my elbow. The shoulders can be exposed, but my left bicep needs to be covered. So either a one sleeve dress (that covers MY left) or something that will just hide that particular area on both sides.\n\nMoreover, I am only 5\u20193, about 130 pounds and busty (34 DDD). I found some off shoulder dresses that could work, but they have a ton of cleavage and that\u2019s not going to fly around my Mexican family who I haven\u2019t seen in 10 years. Ha ha. Some cleavage is totally fine.\n\nAny ideas/links appreciated!! I have dark hair and a tan complexion in the summer so I can get away with a variety of colors. I have a bunch of fun/neutral heel options between my mom and I\u2019s shoe stashes, so no problem there. Thank you!",

Use clothes you already have, or you can go on a \u201cresearch\u201d outing to shops to try on clothes/make different outfits. The aim isn\u2019t to buy anything yet, just try on clothes that fit with the style you\u2019re trying out and take lots of photos. \n\nRepeat for all the styles you\u2019re interested in! If you take photos as you go along, you have an easy way to review everything - what do you like best after going through all this? And what would be most practical for your lifestyle as well? Once you have a pretty good idea of what you want, go through your closet and figure out what you have that fits with that before you shop for anything new.",

This August, I\u2019m going to be spending three days camping, sword fighting and hiking in the Canadian wilderness all while cosplaying as a common foot soldier from a Middle Ages era mercenary company.\n\n\nThis means I need to put together a costume that not only looks convincingly on period but also is truly practical and comfortable for all of the outdoorsy activities and actual sword fighting I\u2019ll be doing while wearing it. I also only can really afford to shop at thrift stores and resale sites such as Poshmark. So how do I go historically accurate-ish Middle Ages soldier utilizing modern made thrifted clothes and keeping my practicality constraints in mind? What types of garments and details should I be looking for to achieve the aesthetic in a way that meets my needs? Additionally, is there a way to slightly feminize the look without losing out on practicality or accuracy?",
