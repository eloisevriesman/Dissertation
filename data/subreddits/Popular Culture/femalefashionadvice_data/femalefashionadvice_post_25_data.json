I\u2019m using a throw-away since I\u2019ll be using old photos of me, but I\u2019d love some help finding a jacket similar to one that used to be a staple in my wardrobe. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out my style and whenever I think of outfits from my past that I felt like myself in, this jacket is always involved! It was originally bought from Forever 21 in like 2012 haha, so I don\u2019t have hopes of finding this exact one, but I\u2019m curious if anyone has found something similar. I\u2019ll add photos below, but here are the qualities I\u2019m looking for:\n\nHits around the hips (neither cropped nor longer fit)\n\nStructured with a slight waist emphasis (not a boxy fit)\n\nNot denim (something neutral that can be worn with jeans)\n\nI loved this jacket since it was neutral enough to go with anything but still felt like a sightly unique piece. I don\u2019t love jean jackets since they usually have a straight/boxy cut, and I don\u2019t love the utility jackets that are similar to this one since they\u2019re longer and feel more casual to me. Most of the similar jackets I find are usually a straight/boxy cut so I\u2019m struggling to find a look-alike! Moto jackets seem the closest but I usually don\u2019t like the fabric of them. This unicorn jacket was cotton/twill, anyone know of a moto jacket made of that material that\u2019s not too cropped?\n\nPhotos:\u00a0[https://imgur.com/a/b2IWGK8](https://imgur.com/a/b2IWGK8)",

There\u2019s going to be a parade the day before the wedding itself, and the dress code for this event mentioned \u2018fiesta\u2019 colors. I\u2019m pretty sure that means bright and colorful, but I ended up buying this powder blue (lol) dress because it\u2019s more practical for me in the long run than a brighter dress. However, I definitely want to be polite and otherwise follow the guidelines to the best of my ability, so I\u2019m looking for advice on how to make this outfit more colorful! Advice on good color combos, patterns, etc. are welcome. This extends to shoes, scarves, jewelry, bags, etc., (though the shoes can\u2019t be heels as the roads are uneven angled cobblestone and the parade will be a bit of a hike- I\u2019m thinking espadrilles.)

I think the Flower of Life hair clips would be a good addition.\n\n[Chunks](https://chunks.shop/) has fun, brightly coloured hair accessories. You can throw in some pins or a claw clip to add colour. I personally think their little flower claws in yellow and pink are adorable, but they do read a bit more childish. [Eugenia Hair Clips ](https://eugeniahairclips.com/collections/shop-all)also has a bunch of fun, brightly coloured hair accessories--their whole thing is making childish designs, though. \n\nI think that shade of blue goes well with a red-orange shade, so you could look at adding that in with a handkerchief, scarf, headband, whatever. \n\nI also think your dress matches well with the [Sky colour of Fiestaware](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2081/7373/files/ColorChronology_2024_b36780e4-8062-4de7-be7a-58ed85e4bd1d.jpg?v=1712675055), which I always think of when I am told something is 'fiesta coloured', so maybe look at the other colours they produced and choosing one or two to add to your outfit! Having a few accessories for both colours (or combine the colours, like a scarf) can help make it look a bit less random.",

You can also try leaning into the oversized aspect and do baggy jeans/cargo pants on the bottom (I think looking drowned in fabric has less to do with your height than the proportions of the shirt to pants, which is why shirt length is important). I also kinda like the bike shorts/no pants look with an oversized tee. Along those same veins, you could try a jersey midi/maxi pencil skirt for a more slim profile on the bottom.",

I don\u2019t care too much about being \u201con trend\u201d but would like to find items that are timeless and classy. I\u2019m a stay at home wife so I don\u2019t need anything super fancy or corporate looking but I do enjoy the \u201ccoastal grandma\u201d/ old money look. Also I\u2019m a winter so I wear a lot of jewel tones. Anyone have any suggestions on where to shop? Bonus if it\u2019s reasonably priced. Thank you! \ud83e\udd70",

Then you can look through and find the core items that will help you dress like that style - for example, if a lot of outfits have black wide-leg trousers, or an unstructured linen blazer, those should be the first things on your to buy list.",

Looking at workwear, there\u2019s always going to be blazers, trousers, blouses, low flat shoes. But the boxy menswear-style blazer of today is going to start looking dated in the future when silhouettes swing back to being more fitted. What style of trousers are considered \u201cclassic\u201d? Low rise slim ankle pants? Super high-rise pleated wide leg trousers? If you\u2019re going for a particular fashion era, either one might be the right answer.\n\nThe reason I brought that up is that timeless and classy aren\u2019t very useful descriptors if OP wants help revamping their wardrobe. Different people are going to have different things in mind, so it\u2019s better to have visuals (for yourself especially) on what you actually want to dress like.",

If you want them, maybe you could get a custom insole for them? I think that without more support, they might not be the most comfortable option for you based on what you\u2019ve said. Or if you\u2019re open to other styles of sandals, I can send a few recommendations your way. I\u2019ve had a dilemma lately of trying to find cute but comfortable walking sandals and I did find a pair from Will\u2019s Vegan Store that have held up pretty well so far, so let me know if you want the link.",

I don't have collapsed arches, but I do have insanely high arches and Birks are some of the only shoes that provide sufficient support for me. Usually people complain about there being too much arch support and having to break the arch in. I find Birkenstocks to be extremely comfortable right out of the box, but in a firm, supportive way, not a cushy way. All this to say, YMMV and it's worth trying them on in store before buying them if you can. In my experience, Birkenstocks last decently long and local cobblers can replace the footbeds and soles when they wear out, which is a pro for me.",

            "body": "Hi everyone, I need some major help. I seem to always find myself frustrated and crying after going shopping. I know some girls dream of it but having a perky chest is not fun. It was great until they got bigger. Now I absolutely hate dressing up because of my boobs. I couldn't even tell you what my size is because it truly changes every week (ever since I got an IUD my boobs become extremely tender and swollen for 1 1/2-2 weeks every month). So picture large and perky boobs and after some \"research,\" my shape/set would be considered wide side-set. With that info...PLEASE HELP!!!\n\nWhat styles/types of shirts work for others with similar shapes? I am leaving for a quick 3-day vacation next week and need to pack light, I'm looking to pack only dresses but I don't know what kind. The only style of dress I've had a good experience with is a V-neck tie front dress (here's the name of the dress, I got it off amazon: miduo Womens Satin V Neck Ruffle Short Sleeve Tie Front High Waist Midi A-Line Maxi Dresses). I know I could get more dresses similar to this style but I want some that aren't too revealing. I recently was a bridesmaid and the dress was a tank top cowl neck dress, it sort of worked I ended up having to go 3 sizes up because of my boobs (even then I had to wear tape, bra, and bodysuit to keep them in check) but had to do major alterations because it was too big everywhere else.\n\nPlease any recommendations/advice/tips literally ANYTHING will help.",

As for clothes, I would say it\u2019s more about finding the right bra because a good bra makes everything fit better dress-wise. Again that may be difficult to do if your size changes regularly. Small changes in size over the course of a month are normal but large changes regularly should be something your doctor looks into.",

Be aware that those changes are permanent though, and to go back you'd have to do a breast lift.\n\n\nI feel like wide, shallow necklines might off-set the visual weight of your boobs. Does off the shoulder count as more covered up? Stretchy fabrics work better for \"\"\"\"uncommon\"\"\"\" body shapes, so look for stuff with a high percentage of elastane.\n\n\n\nIt's kind of difficult to answer your question without knowing what your goals are tbh/what you want from the sub.",
