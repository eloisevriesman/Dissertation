Everything I sold was similar in size/style so more often than not people would bundle a couple $5 items together, which made it more worthwhile. Now that I have kids I don't have space to store a bunch of stuff so if I go back to selling on Poshmark it will only be nicer items that I can get at least $20 for.",
