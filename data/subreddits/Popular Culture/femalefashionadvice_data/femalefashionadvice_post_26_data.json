            "body": "For online shopping, I make a spreadsheet of all the options I\u2019m considering with prices, brand, links to the item, etc. Then I rank them based on how much I like them (and also price\u2026 if one item is $$$ and not a clear favourite, I\u2019m probably not going to order that one) and then decide to order based on that. Anything with bad reviews doesn\u2019t make it onto the spreadsheet in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s a little more time intensive to make the list, but I feel like making it and then walking away and coming back to it the next day makes some decisions a lot easier. Also sometimes really quantifies what you\u2019re looking at - if I need 1 dress and have 20 possibilities, it\u2019s easier to cross out the ones that I like a little less. I usually grey them out so they\u2019re still on the list just in case. \n\nIf I return it because something was wrong with the fit, then I can try the next one on the list, so it\u2019s useful to have those backups handy too.\n\nIdk it\u2019s def a time consuming process for me too, but I\u2019d rather put more thought into it before I buy, then have to waste a lot of time on returns later (or settle for something that is ok but not exactly what I wanted, that I end up not wearing as much as I was expecting to). \n\nI have a \u201cfuture purchases\u201d board on pinterest too that I just pin things that I like when I see them (which helps so much with impulse purchasing), but I do the spreadsheet when I\u2019m actually deciding to buy since it\u2019s more focused. Pinterest is nice if you want to visually compare several things at once though, so that might be another option (could also share with friends easily for opinions rather than sending a bunch of links).",

Sometimes I don\u2019t mind it because I like to give myself time to think something over, but it can be tedious sometimes, as much as I love shopping. I narrow down my options by choosing my favorite brands, which are all sustainable/ethical, and looking there first to see if they have what I want. I also use Good On You as a resource because they have a search and filter tool where you can search specifically for dresses, which sometimes helps me.",

It\u2019s great because I can do it from my phone and also with browser extensions on my computer.

I have categories for just about everything from bed frames to skincare. Basically I f I want to save it for later, it goes into its proper place in Notion. (If there\u2019s no URL I send a screenshot!)\n\nI\u2019m 3 years deep into this database and my strategy for organizing it has evolved so that I truly have a place for every piece of digital clutter. I\u2019ll never call it perfect because it already is perfect in that I can move things around whenever and however I need to. I\u2019ve pulled together a vision board for refreshing my closet. I have another for the interior design and aesthetic of my home. All my work notes/tasks live on a notion dashboard. That stack of random receipts for car maintenance in your glove box? Mine is a QR code connected to a Notion database. It\u2019s the most powerful free tool available these days imo",

It\u2019s more about the event than the dress.\u00a0\n\nIf it\u2019s not an urgent purchase and more to curate my closet, I try to make it more specific by first identifying the gap, what is the occasion and requirement, how does this affect my current style, what details or accessories would really drive this style home. And be absolutely ruthless before making the purchase! I try not to limit myself to \u201cI have to have this one piece\u201d, because style is more about the combination and how you wear it. It\u2019s time consuming for sure but so are other hobbies.",
