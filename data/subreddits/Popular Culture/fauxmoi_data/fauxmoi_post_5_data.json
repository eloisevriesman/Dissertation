But this is only the beginning.\n\n\"Domestic violence is THE issue. It broke me down to someone I never thought I would become. With a lot of hard work, I am better today, but I will always be recovering from my past.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to take this matter seriously. My only ask is that EVERYONE open your heart to believing victims the first time, it takes a lot of heart to tell the truth out of a situation that you were powerless in.\"\n\nShe added: \"I offer my hand to those who are still living in fear. Reach out to your people, don't cut them off, no one should carry this weight alone.\n\n\"This healing journey is never-ending, but this support means everything to me. Thank you. Love always, Cassie.\"",

I was abused for five years and towards the end, I felt like I had no friends left because he was SO good at getting me to isolate myself from others and I didn\u2019t realize it happened until there was no one I could turn to. I stayed cause I thought I\u2019d die if I left, and left because I knew I\u2019d die if I stayed. I was fortunate to forge a connection with an old friend to help get me out. You need people, period. \n\nAnd she\u2019s right that the journey never ends. Happily married now and I couldn\u2019t watch the video nor can I consume any content that even hints towards domestic violence (sorry to Blake lively and Justin baldoni, I guess). \n\nSending love to anyone this story has been hard for.",
