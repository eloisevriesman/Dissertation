So glad Spencer and his brother survived \n\n>Spencer's father Paul Brian Edward Connelly set him on fire aged five alongside his  older brother Fletcher, then an eight-year-old, inside a car in Burnie, west of Devonport, on December 5, 2012. \n\n>The siblings survived however they suffered serious burns in the horror incident. Their father had tried to kill them and himself to prevent their mother from getting custody of them.\n\n>Connelly had placed two gas cylinders in the back of his car when he picked the siblings up from day care 12 years ago. \n\n>Around 5pm that day, he lit the gas cylinders with a cigarette, causing them to explore. \n\n>Spencer suffered burns to nearly half his body while Fletcher suffered burns to more than 20 per cent of his body.  \n\n>Connelly was sentenced to 20 years behind bars with a 15-year non parole period for attempted murder in 2013.\n\n>Spencer, who recovered from his severe injuries but still bears the scars, was offered the opportunity to audition for a role in the film by its director George Miller, who was moved by Spencer's story.\n\n>**\u2019I've always said that I've wanted to make my burns, my scars worthwhile and I believe I've done that now,' he said.**",

FFS there was a guy that cut off a woman\u2019s arms after r*ping her and left her for dead in a ditch that got a lesser sentence for attempted murder, like cmon, he wasn\u2019t thinking about the time, he just assumed (incorrectly) that she would bleed out and die. I\u2019d argue that most people are assuming they would be less likely to get caught if the victim actually dies than thinking about a lesser sentence if they don\u2019t..",

Research has shown that rehabilitative measures are far more cost-effective AND lowers chances of crime reperpetration AND improves chances of convicts  reintegrating into society. No wonder countries like the US has so many problems with its prison system and high incarceration rates of reconvicted released convicts, when barely proper measures are taken to ease convicts back into society and the general public seemingly prefers looking people up forever instead of finding ways to rehab them in some form.",

They\u2019ll consider it\u2019s your responsibility to do all the work and they\u2019ll try to hurt them and take them away from you just to hurt you. \n\nSociety as a whole has a tendency to treat children as objects more than people but the majority of those who treats them the most as objects to cause suffering are their fathers. And they get away with so much of it, it\u2019s insane. They even manage to flip the script and make it sound like they actually want those kids but the evil courts side with women, when kids overwhelmingly end up with their moms cause the dads CHOSE that arrangement and barely pay child support. \n\nHaving kids with a loser is one of the worse things that can happen to you and those very kids.",
