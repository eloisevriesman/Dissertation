The 90s r&b, rap, and hip hop remixes were the BEST, and often totally leveled up solid or even genuinely great tracks into creatively reimagined gems. Or, at the very least, you could see and hear the effort put into the remix by the artists involved, instead of jamming a rap in the middle or at the front and calling it a day.",

It\u2019s kind of a collectors item and she knows it\u2019s obviously going to be shared for free somehow after she takes it down past the 24 hours. I prefer this like you said compared to releasing 5 bonus tracks but you have to physically buy 5 different vinyls to hear 5 extra songs. That\u2019s insanity. And she dropped an extended remix of this fan favorite part of a song people were already wishing was longer and I\u2019ve had that on a loop. Now I don\u2019t have to listen to one song to get to the part I like at the very end. She\u2019s being smart about it and doesn\u2019t feel like you HAVE to collect everything bc her fan base probably wants to be eco friendly as well compared to Taylor\u2019s fan base. I\u2019m sure there are collectors but I don\u2019t get the vibe that\u2019s what Billie wants her fans to do. She has to play the game. Even Beyonce does a few variants. But it\u2019s how you approach it and I\u2019m sure there will be other singles and remixes that Billie drops but no other artist is blatantly trying to block someone\u2019s success each week in a super obvious way than Taylor.
