Plus, her dress had a train AND she was wearing stillettos while trying to walk up the steps.",

Yes French people are \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201crude\u201d or whatever but even without seeing their treatment of other guests it felt extremely inappropriate and specific to Kelly. Now seeing that photo of Heidi it\u2019s clear that their own prejudice informed how they treated Kelly.",
