People aren't just committed to genocide in Palestine, they want to eliminate all traces of Palestinian people and culture from around the world.",

When we say \u201cIntifada\u201d it only means \u201cto shake off\u201d something by rising \u2014 not violence. When we say \u201cmartyrs\u201d we mean all untimely deaths \u2014 we call people who drown martyrs, too, or people who die of cancer. But Western media has decided that it means \u201cdying while fighting\u201d and are using that as a \u201cgotcha\u201d against us. We can\u2019t even mourn the martyred children, whose only crime was to be born on the wrong side of an arbitrary border, without having to go on immediate defense about our language. The way that our entire language and culture are so quickly and easily demonized and policed is so wild to me. An Arab cannot speak without being called barbaric and violent by Western media. The growing anti-Arab sentiments in the West are so shocking and its even more shocking that its just quietly being normalized.",
