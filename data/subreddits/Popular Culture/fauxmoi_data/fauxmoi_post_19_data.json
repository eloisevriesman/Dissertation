Like, it encourages eating disorders, but chain smoking to keep the weight off or purging due to bulimia would make someone's breath horrible. It popularizes pseudoscientific health nonsense, much of which will at best not make you smell better and more likely will actively make you smell worse. It insulates a lot of people from the real world and its consequences, which means some people may never know that they're one of the stinky ones, and those who do don't need to care. And if a famous person is struggling with self care due to mental illness or neurodivergence, I can see how it would make sense to prioritize looks over smell, even though for most people in the real world that would not be the case.",
