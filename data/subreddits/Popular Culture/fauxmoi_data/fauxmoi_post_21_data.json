            "body": "Shortly after a Memphis judge ruled in favor of Riley Keough blocking a foreclosure auction of Graceland and calling for an investigation into Riley's claims of fraud, Naussany Investments has backed off.\n\n\n**A representative for the company, Naussany Investments & Private Lending, said in an email statement that it would withdraw all of its claims over Graceland.**\n\n\n**Naussany Investments had claimed that Elvis Presley\u2019s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley - who died last year at age 54 - had used Graceland as collateral when borrowing $3.8 million** that was never repaid, according to a public notice of the intended sale.\n\n\nPresley's granddaughter, actress Riley Keough \u2013 who inherited the home after her mother's death \u2013 sued Naussany, asserting that her mother never took out the loan and that Naussany was engaged in fraud, including forging her mother's signature on multiple documents.\n\n\n**In a sworn affidavit attached to the lawsuit, the notary public listed on Naussany's documents said she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized her signature.**\n\n\nIn a statement, **Gregory Naussany, whose role in the company is not clear, said it would \"be withdrawing all claims\" and proceeded to blame Riley's mother, Lisa Marie Presley. He did not directly address Keough's allegations of fraud**.\n\n\n\"Due to the Deed of Trust not being recorded and the loan being obtained in different state, legal action would have to be filed in multiple states and NAUSSANY Investments & Private Lending will not acquire to proceed. That comes from consultation of the lawyers for the company. **There was no harm meant on Ms. Keough for her mothers LMP mis habits and mis managing of money**. The company will be withdrawing all claims with prejudice\"\n\n\n**In a statement, Elvis Presley Enterprises, which operates Graceland, said, \"As the court has now made clear, there was no validity to the claims. There will be no foreclosure.\"**",

She did it again right before the auction bullshit broke, and she was also sure to be photographed with her rather press-shy dad (whom was rumored to have left with Lisa and Riley, was living with Lisa when she died, even former scientology members have said his standing is very unclear, Keough family members said he and Riley were out). So I'm wondering if Riley is sending a message to scientology, like, is more going to come out as the fbi investigates?\n\n\nScientology could maybe not be involved at all, but I was rather alarmed by how many former members suggested this is maybe their work.",

If they actually were owed millions of dollars you'd think they'd try to recoup it, but the explanation that the Daily Mail said they gave in their e-mail didn't make a lot of sense\n\nThey claimed that since they lived in one state, and Graceland is in another, they'd have to file the suit in multiple states and how that would be so time consuming and difficult. . .except that's not how civil litigation works in the US.  In a case like that, it would become a matter for Federal court under what's called \"diversity jurisdiction\" (specifically to prevent that sort of situation)\n\nIf they ACTUALLY were an investment firm that was making multi-million dollar loans, you'd THINK they'd have access to legal advice (since they weren't represented in court, since \"Gregory Naussany\" is not listed as being admitted to the Bar in any state) and even a first-year law student would know what I just said about diversity jurisdiction.  \n\nSo, that's yet another reason this is looking like a scam by some forger to steal Graceland, that they're having to run from because someone fought it.\n\nFrom what the Judge said yesterday, he seemed to think this was all a scam too.",
