If they break up, they will still be the two biggest ticketing companies and still have exclusive contracts with many of the biggest venues, meaning many artists are forced to work with them to be able to tour. \nIt could help smaller venues compete, and not have to pay to use Ticketmaster. But Ticketmaster and live nation would still possibly have the biggest share of the industry. \n\nBur this could possibly lead to more legislation or regulations in the industry, I hope. One big thing would be regulating that resale tickets can\u2019t be more than a certain % of the ticket, or more than the OG ticket value. That would help so much with the insane price gouging we see..",
