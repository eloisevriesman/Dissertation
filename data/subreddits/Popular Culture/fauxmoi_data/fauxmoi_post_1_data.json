Michael Bubl\u00e9 has this very charming, happy and innocent personality on talk shows, but was caught on instagram live putting his hands on his wife Luisana in an aggressive way. There was a whole controversy about it; she had to release a video saying he\u2019s not abusing her, while he stands and stares at her. You can just tell from the way he talks to her when he forgets he\u2019s being filmed that he has a bad side and isn\u2019t as goofy and pleasant as he tries to make it seem. \n\nRyan Reynolds: it\u2019s the same formula but nothing has come out about him or anything. But I find his persona and social media verrrry manufactured and fake. Don\u2019t trust him\n\nJennifer Garner has an unsettling fake charm, I thought it was innocent enough until that video where she asks Regina King \u201cwhere are you REALLY from?\u201d (paraphrasing, but the original is actually somehow worse)",
