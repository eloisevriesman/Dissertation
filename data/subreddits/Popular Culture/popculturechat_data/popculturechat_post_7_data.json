Which turned out to be a complete waste of money once I got to the venue and realized chairs are included in the price. \n\nAlso they'll run this VIP Club BS where you get a private lounge area with an  \"exclusive chef menu\" and drinks. Holy hell, the menu was total dog water, very basic foods, poor service, bad cooking and the drinks were insanely priced. $18 for a Yards tall boy, $24 for basic cocktails.
