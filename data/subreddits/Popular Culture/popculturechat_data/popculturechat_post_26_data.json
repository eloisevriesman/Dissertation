My gf and I watched the original series in anticipation and while I don't think the original is perfect, the sequel series is a MASSIVE drop in quality.\n\nIt also ruins a lot of character motivations and decisions from the original, they really do Miranda dirty here. They also really downplay the Big stuff when they rush to reintroduce Aiden which I thought was kind of a slap in the face to everyone who went through all the BS with Carrie in the original. \n\nAll that being said it's almost fun to watch because of how bad it is, and I appreciate the camp.",
