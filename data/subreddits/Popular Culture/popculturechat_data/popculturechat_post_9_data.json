And he goes, 'Great, but let me ask you something. It's not going to be just a bunch of Rocky jokes is it?' I laughed, 'No! No! Give me a little credit, Carl. Of course not! It's a multidimensional character.' And he was like, 'Because I direct and I'm a funny guy and I don't wanna just do a bunch of Rocky jokes. Nobody wants that. Maybe I could be really cheap or something?' And I said, 'Whaaaat?' 'Maybe I could be really cheap?' 'Really? You'd like to do that?' 'Oh, absolutely, that's what I'm saying. I want to play someone funny, not just be a sight gag.' It was so much better. I went back to the writers room and said, 'You're not going to believe this. Carl Weathers wants to be incredibly cheap.' All credit to Carl on that.\"\n\n\n\n[https://www.slashfilm.com/1508464/carl-weathers-idea-for-hilarious-arrested-development-performance/](https://www.slashfilm.com/1508464/carl-weathers-idea-for-hilarious-arrested-development-performance/)",

My whole thing was *I'd already seen it*, because way back in the day the OG show was on late night TV for me, like 2-3am and that was my usual hour to be winding down so it was on and I enjoyed it. (And Im going to guess at least a few gothy night owls did the same)\n\nSo when WWDITS just appeared on Disney one day and it wasn't the same cast and looked a little too... Well not as low budget and quaint. It kind of put me off. Where is Jemaine Clement? Was this not his baby? It felt kind of insulting? And I'm going to guess I wasn't the only one who just kind of glossed over it and went \"didn't I watch this stoned out of my mind 20 years ago???\" \n\nThen after a while I heard more about it, realized it was still Jemaines baby and he just wasn't the star now, and he was trying to rebirth it into a new audience with a bigger budget... Well I had to give it a try. It's *definitely* different, but in a good way I think. I kind of wish they kept it more low scale like before. But I respect it for what it is and it's fucking hilarious.",

Bones goes from Forensic Anthropologist to trailblazing policewoman, and Booth is some sort of Robin Hood cat burglar instead of an FBI agent/sniper. \n\nGibbons' character for that one-off was some sort of grizzled veteran called Sarge.

And there\u2019s an offscreen character that is described as looking like Val Kilmer. So I guess not technically a cameo since he was playing Detective Dobson but it\u2019s still in the spirit.\n\nJJ Watt on New Girl. Really JJ Watt in anything.\n\nSpeaking of NFL players, I love all their cameos in The League. They always play themselves and football is central to the show but they always put such a great spin. There\u2019s a pack that bullies the guys, Deion Sander\u2019s buying Andre\u2019s condo, Adrian Peterson dating Pete\u2019s ex. Marshawn Lynch calling Andre \u201cyeast mode\u201d because of his yeast infection still gets me. Jerry Jones was alright. Mark from Cuba (Mark Cuban) investing in the EBDBBNB kills me. Which reminds me of Snoop Dogg being in it as Taco\u2019s Eskimo brother; I think it was in his Snoop Lion phase too.\n\nNow I\u2019m stuck on sports players so shifting to the NBA - Blake Griffin in Broad City and Ilana taking a pair of his shoes after \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and Baron Davis in Joyride. I\u2019m not including Shaq because I don\u2019t remember any and he\u2019s very stiff, but yeah he does a lot too. Aside from the small cameos, I loved Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, Larry Bird, Patrick Ewing, and Larry Johnson in Space Jam. They\u2019re legends but they committed so hard to this ridiculous scenario. The therapy scene always gets me. Bill Murray and Michael Jordan were good but I don\u2019t consider them cameos.\n\nI\u2019m just about out so I\u2019ll throw out Clayton Kershaw (LA Dodgers pitcher) in the Prince episode of New Girl.\n\nEdit: forgot Marshawn Lynch\u2019s excellent cameo in Brooklyn 99 when Diaz looks forward to interviewing him because he\u2019s always so terse in NFL interviews. Then he won\u2019t shut up \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n![gif](giphy|5xtDarEhYYm34sKARPi|downsized)",

All of the cameos suggest an endorsement of the political center (from center left neoliberals like Biden to center right conservatives like McCain) because politicians materially affect our lives so much that I don't think you can cavalierly include them. It would be one thing if Parks and Recreation more explicitly examined its centrist ideology but what annoyed me was how we are supposed to view the cameos as neutral statements about politics. Perhaps it is because that is how many centrists view things. They often think, in my experience, that the problem in the world is that two equally valid sides just can't put their differences aside and get along.\n\nI think Parks and Recreation's optimism about politics causes it to fall in to the trap of assuming that centrist politicians can be shown and not spark controversy with their liberal fan base. After all, if they are in the center of two extremes then they must all be reasonable people. I think true critical thinking is realizing that just because a dichotomy exists, does not mean the middle of that dichotomy represents ultimate reason. Besides, politicians cannot disentangle themselves from the power they wield in a public context. It is bizarre that people want to treat the weighty things they have done the same way they would treat their friends and family who have never wielded nearly as much power or have had nearly as much of a reverberating effect on the world.",
