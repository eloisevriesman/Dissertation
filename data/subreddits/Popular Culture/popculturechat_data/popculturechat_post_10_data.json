Prior to that, it was always devastating for me to get so many responses from loved ones who refused to believe me and would respond with statements like:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that side of him myself, so I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure that this isn\u2019t your mind just making all of this up?\u201d\n\nFuck that shit. \n\nIt\u2019s so important to believe what abuse victims are saying, and to also understand why it can be incredibly difficult for them to leave that situation.",

Cultivating those other relationships maintains their ego, validation, and gives them deniability. And that was a lesson to learn for sure. I've been abused by multiple people, including the ex who gave me PTSD (I soooo feel her statement about always going to be healing from the past) , and the isolation can be the worst. And people express appreciation for them and how great they are, and meanwhile, you know the truth of your experiences.\n\nAnd society, and abusers, do their hardest to paint anyone coming forward as having an agenda, 'for clout', oh she wants to destroy him, etc and it grinds us down to figuring silence is better, even after we do get out of those situations.\n\nI am glad that Cassie is getting support. I just hate that it took that video release to turn some people's opinions around.",

The outpouring of love has created a place for my younger self to settle and feel safe now, but this is only the beginning. Domestic Violence is THE issue. It broke me down to someone I never thought I would become. With a lot of hard work, I am better today, but I will always be recovering from my past.\n>\n>Thank you to everyone that has taken the time to take this matter seriously. My only ask is that EVERYONE open your heart to believing victims the first time. It takes a lot of heart to tell the truth out of a situation that you were powerless in.\n>\n>I offer my hand to those that are still living in fear. Reach out to your people, don't cut them off. No one should carry this weight alone.\n>\n>This healing journey is never ending, but this support means everything to me. Thank you.\n>\n>Love Always,  \n>Cassie",
