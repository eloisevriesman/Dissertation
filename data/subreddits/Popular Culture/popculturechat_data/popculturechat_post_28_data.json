She has a short and curvy frame, and none of these dresses show that in a nice way. I saw her recently in a white dress that was just odd, to put it politely. The drop shoulder thingy with the straps bending weirdly over her boobs, the gloves that were digging into her upper arms, and that huge peplum thingy around her hips and tummy just made her look bigger than she is. \n\nI mean, look how [gorgeous](https://x.com/kikibridger/status/1679723538817880064) she looks in a dress that fits and hugs her figure.",

The bodice front is constructed from a single piece of fabric and then cut and folded to fit, in the same manner that you'd use a dart, but they put this odd pouf at her bust, which is what's creating the pocket effect you're noticing. It's because they tucked the excess fabric by joining a longer piece with a shorter piece. The seam is clean under the bust. I think it's deliberate, to echo the puff of the skirt, but it comes off as messy instead of purposeful.\n\n....ahhhh I just noticed how terrible the construction of the gloves is. They didn't even give her a proper thumb! I've made gloves - they are a pain - and real gloves have WAY more seams and pieces than that. Poor Nicola, they do not look fun to wear.",
