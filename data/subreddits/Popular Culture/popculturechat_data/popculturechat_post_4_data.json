There\u2019s so much potential for stories.\n\nI myself know someone who lived in a shocking way while keeping up a facade showing a perfect life on social media. She wasn\u2019t even an actual influencer, famous or doing it to make money, just a normal person with a public account and the attention and comments was like toxic addiction to her. Her whole life revolved around it and it affected every single person and aspect of her everyday life, the things I observed and found out about were appalling. Even a normal meal was a whole fake facade where people weren\u2019t even allowed to eat the food as she\u2019d take it away from everyone to photograph but then caption how wonderful of a night it was for everyone eating it together. \n\nEventually it all blew up in her face and she lost her marriage, respect from her own children, the fake image and reputation she had cultivated, her social life, her mental health, happiness, everything.",
