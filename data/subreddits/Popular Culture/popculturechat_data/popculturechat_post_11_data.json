Taylor will drop multiple variants with one new song on each so fans need to buy all variants to hear all of her new songs. During 1989 she released one color variant at a time and advertised them one at a time as limited edition, never revealing she was going to keep releasing more and more limited color versions, so fans didn\u2019t get to pick out their favorite, they were surprised by more each time.\n\nWhat they do is very different, someone better than me could explain in more detail. It\u2019s actually worth looking up and finding a post detailing exactly everything she\u2019s done in this regard, you might find it surprising. But Taylor is 100% not being singled out for being \u201csuccessful\u201d. She\u2019s using predatory business practices to get ahead with numbers and to take advantage of sales from her fans who will buy anything she releases.",

They expected her to have aged out by now but she hasn't, she's still at the top of the game while others who might have had bursts of huge success have come and gone. She IS an anomaly and they can't understand it. \n\nI've seen increased sentiments about how she should \"step aside and give others a chance to occupy her slot\" and it's like....why? It goes deeper than \"she releases too many variants at inconvenient times,\" which is the main issue they're peddling right now to explain away her success - it's actually that they hate that she's still out here, releasing music at a very sustained and steady rate, that's being consumed at a crazy high rate. And I'm sorry, but there's a jealousy element here as well. \n\nShe's a musician who likes creating music, has realized since 2020 that she doesn't have to be bound to traditional music release rules, and realizes that she can still pull off the charts and sales success that a lot of her peers have been unable to sustain, or tap into. Good for her to be capitalizing while she still can, because history has told her that her career should've been down the tubes by now. Completely understandable why she wouldn't want to voluntarily take her foot off the brakes (when she literally still enjoys making music) just because some people thinks it's unfair that she's too popular. \n\nI think she's allowed to want her album to remain #1 as long as possible, and if others want to release 100 more variants to try and compete with her, they are free to - she's not out here trashing Billie's album, she's just promoting herself.",

I also don\u2019t understand this sentiment. No one *deserves* a #1 album spot. The music industry is highly competitive. Why does Taylor need to step aside so that Billie \u2014 another highly successful and influential musician \u2014 has her \u201ctime\u201d at the top? \n\nAlso, releasing some CDs with a few voice memos is hardly \u201cbreaking her neck\u201d to block other artists. If Taylor really wanted to do that, she could have planned to release Anthology in different variants a month after TTPD came out.",

Billie literally said only a few weeks ago that she doesn't care about charts unlike other top artists so now it looks pretty hypocritical for her to be releasing all these remixes and variants to try to get to #1. And her manager should be a little more professional than publicly liking shady tweets about another artist. Billie and her team clearly do care, and they should have planned better, instead of scrambling now after seeing Taylor is predicted to maintain her #1 position.",

It has begun to feel... icky and I can't quite put my finger on it. \n\nFor probably more dedicated swifties than me, if you felt the Billie interview earlier this year was directed (in a shady way) at Taylor, why? I feel like if it was in any way directed at her, it's because Taylor fosters a FOMO consumption amongst her fans. Midnights still doesn't have a single piece of physical media with all the songs on it, and we are coming up on two years post release, yes (please correct me if I'm wrong)? By nature, releasing 4 variants with one exclusive song versus one with  all of the songs is inherently wasteful. I understand it's for charts, etc. We also have singles on a CD... I could go on. People in the TS main sub were very upset about her jet usage, so I'm a bit confused now why offense is being taken when indirect criticism is offered about the inherent wasteful nature of her merchandise selling methods. \n\nBillie inviting a man on stage that remarked Taylor doesn't write her songs? No cool at all. \n\nIn regards to \"not caring about charts\", both artists have made comments (which are now *years* old) that show a flippant manner towards charts. Woman should be allowed to be successful. Taylor go get your bag sis, Billie you too. Is it a bad thing to say that the strive for success could be done in a more environmentally conscious way? At least Billie's variants are colors only. I think arguing that the variants between the two artists are the same is disengenuous when one makes just about every variant exclusive in a musical format way. \n\nI really am a fan of both but Billie was raised as a staunch environmentalist. She still flies commercial. I think her comments were broad and not directly aimed at Taylor but I see where the offense could be taken. Taylor engages in wasteful practices. A lot of artists do - it is a nature of the industry. However, no one has made a fuss (in a way) about the interview except Taylor? \n\nIt seems we hold these women to different standards. Billie is younger and as she develops as an artist, her success must be done in an \"acceptable\" manner. Taylor is a seasoned artist and has had plenty of scandals, but is asking for constant improvement like this valid of her? If this was another top female artist, such as Beyonc\u00e9 or Ariana, etc would this be such a thing? \n\nI'd love to discuss. I enjoy both artists and think both albums are great. :-)",
