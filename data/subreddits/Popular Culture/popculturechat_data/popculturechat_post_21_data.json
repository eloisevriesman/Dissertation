I know Kate Hudson isn\u2019t exactly overworked and stressed out and worried about basic finances. But from what I see on this thread, it\u2019s a lot of people that are basically just saying a relationship was too stressful to fit in to their busy and already hectic lives so not taking one on gave them some temporary peace.\n\nI guess my point is, if for instance we all had a 3 day weekend, maybe we\u2019d all actually be in a less stressful place where we would make time for romance or other kinds of human connection.",
