In addition to what the other poster said about difficulty to work with (which I saw during her set when she stopped multiple times to chastise the crew) she's also said some very public very disturbing things about Bob Marley and his family, which I think has furthered her isolation in the music industry. \n\nWhile she was in a relationship with Wycleaf Jean, she cheated on him with Bob Marley's son and became pregnant. She basically stated that she intentionally hunted out a descendent of bob marley because she wanted to procreate with Bob's offspring because she wanted to be closer to Bob. She wrote a screenplay where she was to play Bob Marley's wife. The Marley family has spoken out against her. \n\nThere were also allegations that she was involved and manipulated in a high control cult that influenced her choices to turn down opportunities.",

It was also a push by the label to market her as a genius etc and meant that writers/producers (New Ark) weren't properly compensated. \n\nNow everything from here is hearsay, but the rumor goes on to say that the people who she screwed over told everyone in the industry not to work with her, and she was blacklisted in the community and hence never made another album. If you look at her career since then, musicians have been skeptical of how she could have been the main producer on an album given that it seemed she had a lack of instrumental musical ability.\n\nI don't think its true, but a lot of people have said since she's very difficult to work with, would fire people for no reason, insisted on being called Ms. Hill and is constantly late (the latter two of which are proven).\n\nWhat's wild is that she's so incredibly talented, that even if she had more help than people thought making music, it wouldn't diminish her artistry IMO. \n\nImportant to add that she rebuffed these claims and was pretty robust in her response. I just love a bit of music drama. You probably didn't expect a mini essay responding to you but here we are.",
