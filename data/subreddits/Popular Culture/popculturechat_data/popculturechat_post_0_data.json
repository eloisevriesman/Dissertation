It's a romance, and I really like the main characters together, so that's fun. Parts of it I love and personally think are super cute. Overall, I think I'm happy with it.\n\nUnfortunately I hate the entire third act and the main conflict and I have no idea how to fix it right now so my current plan is for it to just sit on my computer forever, unread, until the idea of how to fix it comes to me in a dream lol. I'm so disappointed that that part of it just doesn't work for me on the page.",

I just write one and then keep going until the end.

It helped a lot when I was writing in November and gave me the drive to just push through.\n\nGood luck!",
