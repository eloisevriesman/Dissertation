The children, students of Kenya\u2019s Eregi Girls High School, near the country\u2019s border with Uganda, have reported [pain in their knees, making walking](https://i.imgur.com/y8IQJ1V.mp4) and basic movement difficult. Blood, stool, and urine tests [have been conducted](https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/kakamega/five-tests-but-no-results-in-eregi-girls-mystery-illness-4390252), and preliminary tests have found [evidence](https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/kakamega/mayhem-in-eregi-as-schoolgirls-fall-victim-to-mysterious-disease-4388996) of [elevated electrolytes](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24019-electrolyte-imbalance), or an imbalance of important minerals in the body. Officials have not found any pathogen that could be causing these symptoms.*\n\nSt. Theresa Eregi Girls were [vaccinated against COVID-19 on 20 Jul 2022](https://i.imgur.com/L8Yt9ra.jpg). [Could this be](https://twitter.com/mainandegwa232/status/1709879763462938746) the reason why?

If the school is administering a vaccine like that, are there other things they're administering too? Other kinds of vaccines or immunizations? Medicine? Meals? Water? Menstrual products? There's so many different possibilities and points of contamination that could cause something like this. The reports of parents thinking it's \"evil spirits\" also suggests... a whole other layer of potential causes lol. \n\nWhatever it is I hope they can find out and help these girls.

Note the date on that article...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know anything about your friends so I can't tell you anything about their health, but I can assure you the vaccine didn't give them shingles. Do you know all of their medical history and details? How do you know they get sick more and for longer than others? Do you have any idea how many factors go into that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are basing things on anecdotal evidence and once again filling in blanks on your own...its pure nonsense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs \"proof from my eyes and ears\" almost everyone I know got the covid vaccine plus multiple boosters and I do not know a single on with adverse effects from it. Care to explain how that works?",
