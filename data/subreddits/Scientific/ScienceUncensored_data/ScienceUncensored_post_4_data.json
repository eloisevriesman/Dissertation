            "body": "I have heard about this DNA plasmid hypothesis, I can't rule it out, and in light of the fact that common sense studies needed to confirm this hypothesis are bizarrely deliberately not being done by orgnaziations such as FDA/CDC, whose very job is to perform these basic safety studies (but instead they are too busy manipulating science and basic statistics to prevent early treatment/prevent any treatment that can possibly compete with the vaccines:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/172d94c/the\\_bizarre\\_study\\_that\\_was\\_used\\_to\\_practically/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/172d94c/the_bizarre_study_that_was_used_to_practically/)\n\nThis PhD expert says he can do the study in 3 hours, but FDA/CDC ignored him:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEWHhrHiiTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEWHhrHiiTY)\n\nwe just have to guess on whether it is true or not.\n\nPersonally I am not too convinced, because this is Pfizer yet Moderna had identical side effects, does this mean the exact same production problem happened with Moderna? And not just Pfizer and Moderna, but virtually all spike protein based vaccines, regardless of whether they are mRNA or not, cause abnormally/astronomically higher rate of adverse effects compared to non covid vaccines. Also, Moderna has a higher rate of adverse effects, and we know it has 3x as much mRNA so 3x as much spike protein. And there are studies showing the spike protein independently appears to be causing heart issues. So my own hypothesis is that these vaccine adverse effects are due to the unnatural toxic spike protein of this accidentally lab leaked artificial virus, and the more spike protein you get the higher chances of symptoms. That would explain why the virus, and all spike protein based vaccines, are all causing the same sorts of symptoms. It would also explain why milder covid results in relatively less long covid symptoms but can still cause long covid symptoms: less spike protein proliferates in the body but there is spike protein in the body nevertheless.",

The syndrome is characterised by blood clot formation (thrombosis) combined with low platelet levels (thrombocytopenia).\n> TTS is different to other more commonly diagnosed blood clotting conditions as it is triggered by an immune response that causes the combination of both clots and low platelets.\n>Having a history of blood clots, like deep vein thrombosis (DVT), does not increase your risk of TTS due to the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\n\n\n> Risk of death due to TTS from receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is 1 in a million\n\n> Risk of TTS from receiving the AstraZenecaCOVID-19 vaccine is less than 30 in a million\n\n>  Risk of death due to rock climbing is 3 in a million\n\n> Risk of death from a general anaesthetic is 18 in a million\n\n> Risk of death from giving birth is 67 in a million\n\n> Risk of being struck by lightning is 2 in a million\n\n\nhttps://www.science.org.au/curious/people-medicine/astrazeneca-vaccine-risk-death-1-million-what-does-mean\n\nSo getting TTS is 1 in 30million and then from there dying from TTS is 1 In a million of those who get TTS.

Furthermore in many places people are forced to give birth.\n\nYour whole argument is this idea that you were forced to to take a vaccine and yet we are forced to do many things or suffer repercussions.  Wear seat belts when driving for example.  Regardless though your argument hinges on the safety of the vaccine and The data points out that that safety is far less a concern than those things mentioned above.   Shifting to the government forcing someone is also not entirely accurate.  Most governments made a vaccine optional but the companies made it mandatory which is their right as you then become a risk to the safety of the other employees as well as yourself which makes unvaccinated a legal liability.   Sure you don\u2019t have to get a vaccine but you do have to accept the social repercussions of that choice.",

You cannot get an FDA approved covid vaccine in the US. Call pfizer and they'll tell you that it's the same ingredients and formulation as comirnaty. That's a weird response to what should be a simple yes or no question...\n\nAnd the reason is because they used a different manufacturing process for publicly available vaccines (process 2). If you read the fda approval for comirnaty, it's very clearly based on a singular and established manufacturing process (process 1) \n\n>An October 2020 amendment to the protocol of the pivotal Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) clinical trial (C4591001) indicates that nearly all vaccine doses used in the trial came from \u2018clinical batches\u2019 manufactured using what is referred to as \u2018Process 1\u2019.[3] However, in order to upscale production for large-scale distribution of \u2018emergency supply\u2019 after authorization, a new method was developed, \u2018Process 2\u2019. The differences include changes to the DNA template used to transcribe the RNA and the purification phase, as well as the manufacturing process of the lipid nanoparticles. Notably, \u2018Process 2\u2019 batches were shown to have substantially lower mRNA integrity.[4,5] \n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj.o1731/rr-2",

The patients who do survive are usually as healthy after that time as they were before getting cancer. Without treatment this cancer is generally fatal in months. \n\nDespite being an oldie and of course aging in the intervening years, I'm healthier and happier now than I was before getting cancer.",

Some have a short infection period and mutate often and for others it's pretty much the opposite. That means with some you could have very strong lifelong immunity from a vaccine, but with others you can only get a strong immunity for a shorter period.\n\nVirus like COVID and the flu that spreads through the air, and infects our breathing system, tend to have a faster rate of mutation. If you get the disease and develop natural immunity from fighting it off, you can still contract it months later, because it's mutated and your body isn't fully prepared for how it's changed.\n\nThis is also why there's a lot of talk about updating the vaccines. The vaccines that were rolled out were designed on the original variant. Since then it has mutated a lot and the more it mutated, the less effective the vaccines became. They still had some effects and that's why some received a third shot, while research went into updating the vaccines.",

So be careful before you speak your mind on the subject. It seems harsh but it would be very dangerous to the world if people had access to information that said that the Covid vaccine is anything but safe and effective. \n\nWe need to control the information the masses have access to for safety. Some people have thoughts that might make people have thoughts that are not in support of vaccines. If there words get out into the public and some people don\u2019t get vaccinated, then can you imagine how scary of a world we would live in?\n\nEven though there is free speech, it is important to monitor speech on social media and ban accounts that speak information that has been deemed dangerous. \n\nInformation such as a person saying they had complications after getting a vaccine and that others should be careful. Unless they are a doctor and they have absolute proof that their illness had anything to do with the vaccine they should not be allowed to speak. They are just reacting to their sickness most of the time and trying to find something to blame. Vaccines are an easy target. \n\nVaccines are safe and effective.
