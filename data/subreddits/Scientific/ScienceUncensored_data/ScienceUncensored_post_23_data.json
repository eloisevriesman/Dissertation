            "body": "[The ozone hole above Antarctica has grown to three times the size of Brazil](https://www.space.com/ozone-hole-antarctica-three-times-size-of-brazil)\n\n*One possible reason for the higher-than-normal growth is the Hunga Tonga volcanic eruption in January 2022, which introduced massive quantities of water vapor into the air. The water vapor could have led to the heightened formation of polar stratospheric clouds, where chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can react and accelerate ozone depletion.*\n\n\nversus\n\n[Antarctica\u2019s Temperatures Rose 70\u00b0F Above Normal Last Year](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/16snkoq/antarcticas_temperatures_rose_70f_above_normal/)\n\nIt's evident that similarly to carbon dioxide levels ozone hole is driven by climatic trends [rather than human activity](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/rebuilding-ozone-layer-how-world-came-together-ultimate-repair-job).

I'm here to chat with you and answer your questions. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe statement you shared is partially true, but also exaggerated. Let me explain.\n\nIt is true that satellite data shows that this year's ozone hole over Antarctica is one of the biggest on record, roughly three times the size of Brazil or twice the size of Antarctica itself\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3. The ozone hole is a natural phenomenon that occurs every year during the Antarctic winter, when cold air creates polar stratospheric clouds that deplete the ozone layer, which protects us from harmful ultraviolet rays\u2074.\n\nHowever, it is not true that the eruption of Tonga's underwater volcano in January 2022 is the main cause of the large ozone hole. Scientists are not sure why this year's ozone hole is so large, but some researchers have speculated that the volcanic eruption could be one of the factors that contributed to it, along with other natural variability and climate change\u00b9\u00b2\u2075. The eruption injected a record-breaking amount of water into the stratosphere, which could have caused cooling and more formation of polar stratospheric clouds\u2075.\n\nThe statement that we can't live above ground if the hole gets bigger is also false and alarmist. The ozone hole does not affect the amount of ozone in other parts of the world, and it usually closes by the end of November when the stratosphere warms up\u2074. The international community has banned the use of ozone-depleting substances since 1989, and the ozone layer is expected to recover by the end of this century\u2074. However, we still need to be careful about our exposure to UV rays and protect our skin and eyes from sun damage.\n\nI hope this clarifies your question. If you have any other questions or want to chat about something else, feel free to ask me. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 10/7/2023\n(1) Ozone Hole is one of the BIGGEST on record: Gap over Antarctica is now three times the size of Brazil - and it could get even larger. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12596861/Ozone-Hole-one-BIGGEST-record-Gap-Antarctica-three-times-size-Brazil-larger.html.\n(2) Ozone hole over Antarctica is one of the biggest on record. https://www.wionews.com/science/ozone-hole-over-antarctica-is-one-of-the-biggest-on-record-643483.\n(3) Large ozone hole detected over Antarctica. https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/india/large-ozone-hole-detected-over-antarctica/ar-AA1hNt0B.\n(4) 'One of the biggest on record': Ozone hole bigger than North America .... https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/weather/one-of-the-biggest-on-record-ozone-hole-bigger-than-north-america-opens-above-antarctica.\n(5) Hunga Tonga undersea volcano eruption to make ozone hole larger | Space. https://www.space.com/hunga-tonga-will-make-ozone-hole-larger.\n(6) Huge Tonga volcano may be to blame for ozone hole over Antarctica | Space. https://www.space.com/antarctic-ozone-hole-early-hunga-tonga.",
