Intriguingly most people in comments never noticed them before. A little white worms found in beef can be a tapeworm species known as Taenia saginata, Taenia solium, Taenia asiatica etc. They in fact cause a parasitic infection called taeniasis in humans. You may also know them as beef tapeworms in common.
