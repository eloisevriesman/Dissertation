Risk of deaths in the treatment group was 63% vs controls and this survival benefit was consistent in all age groups.  No torsade de pointes or malignant ventricular arrhythmias observed during treatment (hydroxychloroquine is thus safe for heart).*\n\nThese results could be undoubtedly even better if they would use a full Dr. Zelenko protocol, i.e. including antibiotics and mineral zinc supplements. Also the dose used  (2 \u200b\u00d7 \u200b200mg for five days) was rather low.
