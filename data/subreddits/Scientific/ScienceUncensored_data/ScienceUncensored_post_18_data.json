In August and September 2023, the consensus of other labs was that LK-99 is not a superconductor at any temperature but only bulk non-thin film samples have been made. None of replications have gone through the peer-review process of a journal.\n\nHowever, this is the most important part because only the chemical vapor deposited thin film has the zero resistance superconducting measurement.  The original team says that the thin film chemical vapor deposition process is the only one that has superconducting resistance. The thin film is microns thick and is nearly half superconductive material. See also:\n\n* [The matching international LK99 patent is here.
