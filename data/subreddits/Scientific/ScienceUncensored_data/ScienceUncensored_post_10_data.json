It was apparently the cause of many a salacious rumor and accusation. I'm quite sure several people died on duels and assassinations because of said allegations, so a worthwhile investment to be sure. Lots of women were embarrassed, flustered, or even horny over it, and male doctors stuffing their face in boobs probably had a same effect on them.\n\nEdit, a similar tool is a speculum, used by gynecologists to get a better view: previous to that it was all fingers, sometimes an assistant, sometimes the doctor. The speculum cleared up a similar problem. Of course there were people that wouldn't allow one to be used because apparently its enough to \"ruin virginity\" so there was that argument for a while.",

We have both lived lives that, more than likely, have added value to ourselves to some degree. The only real difference between us, at this stage, is that I'm still ambulatory, and they need assistance.\n\nThe issue arises in that, if I help, I risk my value, in the eyes of society, going down drastically. And that's the minimum punishment, assuming I don't actually get fined or jailed because someone believed some bimbo's accusations, which inarguably DOES occur in our world. If I don't help, the worst thing that happens is that people think I'm kind of a dick, assuming anyone knows that I noticed and didn't help at all. I don't lose access to my livelihood, I don't lose nearly as much reputation, comparatively, I don't really lose anything at all.\n\nSo, why bother? A basic cost-benefit analysis says that it isn't worthwhile, not because of anything that I may or may not gain, but because of what I may or may not lose. And I am not willing to, nor is it acceptable to demand that I, risk any part of a life that I am quite enjoying on a complete dice roll of an action.\n\nAs for statistical insignificances, the ridiculously vast majority of men do not rape, have never thought of raping, and will never rape. Yet, such accusations are things that we must worry about in the modern day, because the modern legal system has proven that it is lucrative for women to accuse someone, because they will be publicly showered with affection and support before any proof is ever offered and gone over by actual professionals in an actual court of law. People like you are just mad that it's your turn to be worried about a statistical insignificance, perhaps you shouldn't have set such a precedent.",

Leave, say nothing to no one about who you are, and just wait to see how things play out.\n\nWould it be saving someones life or self defense, use every right you have as it all falls on the government to prove everything. Combine that with they can't use you using your rights as proof of guilt, this means its a impossible to prove case.",

When I was a kid, it was the conservatives, but nowadays it seems to be the left...  Its really very simple, human beings are human, they feel emotions, they observe potential risks, they feel anxiety, depression, happiness, sadness, etc.  Seeing someone dieing pulls on the emotions and makes the average person want to help.  But the potential risk that might go along with helping also plays a factor, which increases anxiety and so on.  In fact, most people won't jump in to do CPR out of anxiety for what ever reason they have, outside of male to female CPR.  Thats just a fact, when tragedy strikes, most people are not the sort of person you want to lean on for it.  Adding in a potential sexual assault allegation, well that just creates a perfect excuse for someone to say \"welp, fuck that I am not doing that.\"  Its a very human response.  People not understanding this just seem like robots to me.",

Bravery is simply the ability to overcome ones own fears.  If someone is realizes a risk, and is afraid of taking said risk they have perceived, and then faces it head on and does it anyway, that is brave, whether or not you believe it or not.\n\n>I just do what I want I want to do.\n\nSo that is your moral code.  You essentially don't empathize with others, and you look out for what you want, and not what others want. \n\n>I just can't believe people are so stuck in their imagination that they get paralyzed by it.\n\nWe are all in our imaginations lol.  It is actually impossible to perceive everything, its your brain that is filling in the blanks all of the time.  For instance, did you know your peripheral vision is actually in black and white?  The reason people don't realize this is because our brain straight up fills in the missing information with what ever it imagines, which turns out tends to be pretty accurate.  When ppl take hallucinogens you are actually playing with that aspect of human perception, and forming new neural pathways, which is whyt there is a following for ppl to experiment with them to see things in a different light and even help deal with things like depression and anxiety.   You can actually see a great example of it with brain tricks, optical illusions, etc.  Like [this.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cIWyID6osmE)",

We all, whether we want to or not utilize our imaginations to act, it's literally impossible to not, you'd be paralyzed with fear or you'd have to lack the ability to be self aware.  This ability can absolutely paralyze you though and that is different.  But its the same phenomenon that is being utilized in both situations.  We can be wrong about how we percieve the world.  Yes, even you can be wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Of course we have an imagination.

When you drive your car, how do you know all the nuts and bolts are assembled correctly to the right torque?  You don't, you make this assumption, based on your life experiences, you are imagining that it should be safe.  Well, we do the same thing in reverse.  From some's perspective, thats a risk that they arent willing to make.  Who's right?  who's wrong?  well, thats not for me or you to judge.  That'll be evolution, or God's place whatever you believe.",
