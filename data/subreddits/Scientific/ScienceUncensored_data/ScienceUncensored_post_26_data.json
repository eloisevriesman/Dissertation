Yes, if you can cut out the source of an ailment, then of course you would be cured. But that isn't what happens in the treatment of gender dysphoria. \n\nTransitioning doesn't cure the cause, it just temporarily alleviates symptoms of dysphoria. If a person stops transitioning, they will continue to experience gender dysphoria, I'm sure you would agree. Transitioning as a treatment for gender dysphoria is more akin to taking antidepressants for depression than it is cutting out a tumor. Much like how the treatment for bipolar disorder that didnt respond well to medication is to just try and live a healthy lifestyle. That doesn't cure their condition, but can help alleviate the extremes of manic and depressive states.",

In some US states they passed laws allowing gym teachers and sports coaches to check out girls coochies to make sure they are \"actually girls\"\n\nWe have to fight back. Our rights are being eroded for hate. Its already politicized, what can we do? The science says the best thing to do is accept people and leave them be, Which is my political philosophy. Sadly the party supposed to represent that is creating a cultural war as they swing towards extremism.\n\nThe last time a western nation passed similar laws was 1938 Germany... Now several US states. Banning and burning books, limiting educational content, controlling who does what where and genital inspections. Its fucking disgusting and I'm sure you agree. What choice do we have but to politicize it right back? For evil to win all we have to do is sit back and say nothing.\n\nAll over a simple change to the literature. I'm sure politicizing gay rights in 69 and civil rights in 76 made a lot of people uncomfortable too. What choice do we have in the face of segregation and religious rule?\n\nSo every time someone says \"they aren't real\" or \"don't deserve equal treatment\" we get riled up! The discussion is more than the one liners and buzz words and marketing. There is a claim right now that Ukranian's are not real and therefore deserve their freedoms and political decisions taken from them. Same shit, different place.  \n\n\nI don't know much about social studies or gender studies but I know more than enough biology to account for a small number of people bein several deviations from the norm. Its a statistical reality smaller than a rounding error. As populations grow into the billions there are enough to form communities.  \n\n\nMost rural towns and schools have none in their regions or cities.

Have you seen the age of the average senator and congress person? Its mostly the same people sitting in the same chairs.\n\nFrom the episode \"White Power\" from Sam Harris speaking to an ex skin head Neo Nazi (poorly paraphrased) 'We traded in our tattoos and leather for briefcases and suits, we changed from using words like Jews to Globalists and the goal was to make our talking points mainstream' -10 years later id say they succeeded.\n\nDo tell of this pendulum? Is it only in the US? Seems to me that lots of Authoritarian and theocratic nations could see it swing the other way any day now. Democracy is under attack from the extremes, not just 'right wing values' but actually controlling speech and thought and attempting to enforce it with violence or shut down the nation. \"right wingers\" don't attempt to take the capitol and vow to hang their opponents. Most are civil and want a democracy or republic of some kind.\n\nI know right wingers in my life who are appalled by what they see. They may not like the progressive left but they like Authoritarians of any side a lot less. A small minority of republican senators and congress people are trying to hold the whole nation hostage. Its not a really a typical democratic swing nor is it a both sides thing.",

You probably have a vocabulary of over 2000. adding 1 or 2 won't harm you in the least. Being stubborn about nothing is pointless.  \n\n\nWait till you discover the nomenclature in Herps. Sometimes a stripe or colour difference classified different salamanders as entirely different species even if they are genetically extremely similar and interchangeable.   \n\n\nIf we find a physical difference then we can apply a name to it. If there is a potential these people are in reality, and biologically that can be so, then there is no argument to be had. I don't know much about social studies but form follows function in biology.

Even if a single person in the world was born outside of a definition, it would be enough to prove that the rule is not enough to define everyone. At the end of the day, sex is still another socially constructed concept, with multiple definitions that are meant to describe what is true in the majority of cases, but will never be enough to describe all of them. Some of these definitions are based on characteristics that can be changed through medical interventions, such as morphologic aspects (sex organ and secondary sexual characteristics) and dominant sex hormones, and as medicine evolves more of these characteristics will be able to be changed, that is effectively the same as changing sex, which proves that sex is not immutable.",

Having said that, I'll violate my own rules and say this feels very much like the argument of a group of people who wanted to jam everyone into a binary definition.  \n\n\nIt doesn't look like it stems from understanding the conditions themselves, and coming at them from the perspective of 'this must be male or female' looks very much like an argument set in feelings and keeping the status quo rather than an objective look at facts.  \n\n\nWe can obviously point to cases where individuals won't produce gametes at all, where they will outwardly present as male but have ovaries and vice versa. You want us to then argue that the bearded person with a penis, who insists they are a man, is in fact a woman because they possess eggs? Eggs that are functionally useless to them without direct medical intervention?  \n\n\nA binary definition demands one or the other. A spectral definition says a person can be somewhere along that line. Even if you want to define sex what gametes are produced, you come across cases where no gametes are produced, or true hermaphrodites. Or even animals where the entire sexual reproductive organs will metamorphize and they will go from produce one gamete set to another.  \n\n\nThe fixation on a gender binary seems useless and futile in the face of nature.",

In the late 19th century that was changed to breed, kind, or sex, still referring to the biological reality.\n\nLater, John Money refashioned the term by linking it with identity. That meant making a false distinction between biology and self perception. Since some men and women had slightly varying degrees of masculine and feminine behavior, some even sharing across these lines, political and social groups with converging interests saw an opportunity create social chaos upsetting what they viewed as the oppressive patriarchal dominant class. So behavior became conflated with identity and societal roles were attacked.\n\nThe problem with the logic in this is behavior is largely genetic. It's not immutable, but forcing artificial changes in someones behavior leads to disastrous outcomes, as we plainly saw with 2 of Money's victims. Maternal and paternal behaviors are instincts. They are genetic. Therefore the roles they play stem from their genetics. So even if we accept the distinction between gendered behavior and biological sex, it still leads to a binary outcome.

They do not. They are subversive propaganda masquerading as philosophy or thoughtful critique. In short, the modern perception of these constructs comes from these people who had a vested interest in destroying the nuclear family that they viewed as an obstacle to be overcome, and not as the natural result of a healthy people and a healthy society.",

Conveniently disregarding things you don't like to look at does not make them less real.\n\nIn Biology there are two main hormones that determine behavior in a typical man. Men with more Oxytocin tend to be providers, loyal partners and dedicated parents, men with more testosterone tend to take on multiple partners, give no fucks for offspring. Its visible from groundhogs on up.\n\nYour \"genetic\" claims are not based on anything. I studied biology. Behavior is a result of Hormones, brain wiring and cultural rewards/stimulus.\n\nI know a family with many kids. Some of the boys ended up with their mother's body type and others with their father's. Some ended up with their mother's personality type and others with their fathers. Using this simple example we can see how genetics get mixed and recombined in near random ways. They had at least one miscarriage and so recombination can lead to non viable combinations as well. These are as far as I know all cis people.\n\nFor most people societal constructs do match biological ones. We all know people whop are great fits to stereotypes and norms and they have zero social/cultural struggles in society. However Genetics is near random there is no mechanism in the body or in the genome to pair this with that, chains from both parents get taken and filled into a chromosome that is not even necessarily viable as an organism.\n\nYour assumption (aside from your conspiratorial nonsense that has nothing to do with the current discussion) is that EVERYONE must fit because you fit. Biology doesn't work that way, otherwise evolution could not be possible. Mutation and recombination are the mechanism of evolution and genetics. Change and variance are necessary for natural selection to even work...\n\nIts why boys raised by hunters are much more likely to be hunters than boys raised by programmers. Same was true in ancient societies when many sons of lords got into accounting or science or theocracy, not all boys are warriors. Its often cultural, not genetic. My father is a soft and empathetic man, My mother is a hard ass get shit done kind of person. My grandfather was an engineer and in no way a violent hunting hardass of a man that was the norm of his time, his wife went back to work after having kids and was shunned by many. They fail to match the stereotypes and norms in your assumptions but are only within 1 SD of the norm, they were always mocked and ridiculed by the normies despite being very similar. People who differ 2SD and 3SD from the norm (so that's the 10% and less than 1% on the ends of a bell curve) won't. Greeks were known to be tough guy oiled up by little boys gay guys and were shocked when Persian warriors approached wearing eye liner. Koreans have a period of their history they mock in film of how soft and silky and pretend wail-y the ineffective leaders of the Josen period are sometimes depicted to be. I had a flamboyantly gay Korean (from like a mile away) manager who's cousin, an adult man with a family and career, had no idea and said \"some people in my culture are just like that\". If your claim is true when do many men and women chose to become monks or nuns? are they \"not real?\" Why do other cultures not see what you claim as strictly as your universality makes it sound?\n\nNow we understand society is constructed for the \"Norm\" that's obvious and to be expected. The problem is that those who differ should not be stoned to death or jailed (as they are in most countries) nor should their exitance be illegal or invalidated. We should not be banning books that talk about them nor limiting studies (modern studies in the free world) into how other sub sets of culture live. They should be allowed to live and let live.\n\nI'm not shifting goal posts or hair splitting. I've met all these kinds of the people in these communities. They are different and I fail to see the problem. Appeal to nature is also a logical fallacy I will remind you since you seem to think you are immune to fallacy.\n\nThe whole \"Its communism\" you allude to is nonsense. Just because the Soviets allowed women to work in most jobs first doesn't invalidate their contributions to businesses does it? Just because the Soviets gave equal rights to Blacks and minorities before the US did (at least on paper) doesn't mean segregation is a \"natural and genetic norm\". Even if that's what some geriatric senators seem to think, because in their era those were not the norm... Also founding fathers in the US wore wigs, makeup and robes... Kinda makes you wonder how norms shift and change over time...\n\nAlso your claim to the nuclear family is hilarious. Its only been around for 2 generations in very wealthy western nations. The norm elsewhere is everyone living in the same room for all the living generations.",

I've heard and read stories of people who did the surgery and they experience nothing but pain on a constant basis.  In the example of M2F bottom surgery:  Every man knows you grow hair on the shaft of your penis.  Well, penile hair removal isn't a part of the surgery and they're given a tunnel that grows hair on the inside.  Simple tasks like urinating are extremely messy and time consuming.  If they don't dialate their \"Vagina's\" on a regular basis, it'll heal up leaving countless hair follicles growing deep under scar tissue causing infection.  This is just an example of some of the uphill battles these poor people need to constantly go through in order to \"feel happy\" in their true form.  I for one can't wait for the influx of lawsuits comming in the next 10-15 years.",

Some of these characteristics can be changed, which is effectively the same as changing the sex of a person, and as medicine evolves, more of these characteristics are inevitably going to be able to be changed as well if so desired. So not only is sex not binary, but bimodal, it is also a concept that was constructed by humans to try to describe what is true to the majority of the population but not the entirety of it, and it is not immutable and can be changed.",
