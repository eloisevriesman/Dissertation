It's a similar mentality to playing video games, but instead it's these kinds of games: competing for higher numbers, less taxes, more lobbying, anything you can do to show off.\n\nThe problem is it's selfish in that it doesn't think about the negative consequences for those actions.  It doesn't think about the harm on thousands or millions of people all just for bragging rights.",

Official income statistics left out welfare payments so those receiving them often appeared to still be living below the poverty line when, by other measures, government assistance demonstrably helped.\n\nI've always wondered about this.  I prefer creativity and socialization over consumption, which means I spend very little.  So because of that despite having plenty of money, I tend to spend below the poverty line out here in Silicon Valley, which is about 57k.\n\nIf I ate out every day of the year at a decent sit down restaurant I would spend 36k, combined with an above median rent of $2000 a month I'd spend 60k a year, I'd be just over the poverty limit.  This seems insane to me.  I can live comfortably, regularly travel to Europe for vacation, eat out, have a decent reliable car, and still be in poverty?  The numbers always seemed off to me.  Apparently out here all those things are not enough to be considered a liveable wage.\n\nNow to be fair, that would be a bit tough with a kid, but the poverty limit is set based on size of household, so 57k is one person.  It goes up for two people, and a kid is a 3rd person, so it goes up higher to account for that.",

For real guys.\n\nHe's seriously concerned about white people dying, especially via what he and Case call [deaths of despair](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190785/deaths-of-despair-and-the-future-of-capitalism), i.e. drug and alcohol deaths and suicides. Of course our polluted water and air and food haven't played a role, duh! Or any of that other stuff. We've been CHOOSING to poison OURSELVES!!\n\nAnd you know what else doesn't play a role, because Case and Deaton didn't even think to mention it in their book? Student debt. BOOM. Economists from Princeton know that crushing debt is sort of like, an insignificant detail. Because of course no one who hasn't graduated has student debt, and in fact, college educated people are currently [flourishing.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/opinion/life-expectancy-college-degree.html) (\\*\\* please correct me if I'm wrong. I thought I paid careful attention while listening to their book but could've missed something. \\*\\*)\n\nYou can tell Deaton really cares about the poor because he's promoting progressive policies like [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/opinion/life-expectancy-college-degree.html):\n\n>We are encouraged by the efforts of both public and private employers to remedy this; it is a low-cost policy that could have large benefits. For example, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania signed an executive order removing the B.A. requirement for 92 percent of state jobs; similar policies are in place in Utah, Maryland, Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey and Alaska.  \n>  \n>Anything that reduces health care costs would help, as would replacing employer-funded health insurance with vouchers paid for by general taxation. Fighting NIMBYism (residents\u2019 \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d opposition to local development) and expanding affordable housing in successful cities would increase mobility. Job creation under the Inflation Reduction Act is a move in the right direction. Working people would do better with stronger unions and fewer hostile measures such as right-to-work laws.\n\nDid he say \"vouchers\"? Oh wait . . . is Sir Dr. Deaton from Princeton possibly trying to distract us from ACTUALLY progressive policies, such as universal health care, free (and public?) post-secondary education, stricter water, air, and land protections, undoing the hoarding of real estate by the wealthy, more rigorous food safety standards, jobs guarantees, student debt relief, support for small farmers and action against conglomerate farms, etc. Though it is cool he is advocating for unions . . . but history shows that union gains can be easily undone as needed. Hmmmmmm.\n\n(And a bit of extra fun, the Princeton economists also say that its our [mental distress](https://qz.com/583595/deaths-of-despair-are-killing-americas-white-working-class) that caused some of us to support Bernie Sanders, rather than any sincere and rational belief in the need for collective action.
