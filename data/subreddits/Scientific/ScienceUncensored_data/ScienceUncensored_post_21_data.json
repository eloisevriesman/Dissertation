More deaths occurred among white-collar vs. blue-collar workers. The organization also reported [a sudden jump in employee deaths](https://www.soa.org/49b504/globalassets/assets/files/resources/experience-studies/2022/group-life-covid-19-mortality-12-2022.pdf) in the fall of 2021. Independent sites aggregating Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data confirm these trends. According to [U.S. Mortality](https://www.usmortality.com/), excess deaths in September 2021 among 25- to 44-year-olds were [70% above normal](https://www.usmortality.com/excess-mortality/percentage/united-states/25-44)*\n \n*That number has thankfully dropped, but as of May 2023, the most recent month for which data are available, deaths in this age group remained 10% above expected. Among people under 25, it was [16% above normal](https://www.usmortality.com/excess-mortality/percentage/united-states/0-24). Experts have posited all sorts of theories, from [rising obesity rates](https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/17/america-covid-excess-deaths-worse-other-rich-countries-85-percent/) to [extreme heat](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/07/21/heat-deaths-increase-climate-change-effects-worse/70436488007/) to lagging effects from [lockdowns](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00469580221139016) to wider [alcohol abuse](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791852). These possible contributors deserve careful consideration. Given the [sheer number](https://openvaers.com/covid-data) of COVID-19 vaccine deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, more than 36,000 to date, the possible role of vaccines should be examined, too*.\n\nThese questions are getting increasingly rhetoric, given the fact how excess of deaths correlates with vaccination status levels [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/15tp0ah/australian_scientists_find_disturbing_patterns/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/16woqzd/covid_vaccines_causally_linked_to_increased/) both in time, both in space.

                    "body": "Does it correlate? From the article in the original post:\n\n\u201cComparing state-level excess mortality percentage estimates to estimated COVID-19 vaccinated percentages shows a moderate negative correlation for both the U.S. population and the Group Life data for the third quarter of 2021.\nFor subsequent periods, although some negative correlation was still seen in most periods, it was less pronounced than the third quarter of 2021. Note that Figure 9.21, which looks at the correlation based on the percent of the population with a completed primary vaccine series and an additional dose (booster) as of December 31, 2021 shows a small positive correlation for the Group Life data for the 2022 period. but with a very low R^2 statistic. which\nindicates that vaccination rate does not explain much of the variation in excess mortality.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, when you look at the county level, vaccination status is both more strongly associated  with lower mortality (being negatively associated at all time points) and shows a higher R^2:\n\n\u201cSimilar to the state-level analysis for the U.S. population, the county-level analysis shows negative correlation between the excess mortality percentage estimates and the percentages of the population that are fully vaccinated As was the case with the state-level analysis, the third quarter of 2021 shows a steeper slope than the subsequent periods. In comparing the county-level and state-level graphs, the R? statistics suggest a stronger fit at the county level relative to the state level. However, the steeper slopes on the state-level graphs relative to the county-level graphs suggest a larger change in excess mortality per percentage change in vaccination rate at the state level.\u201d\n\nIt seems that mortality is not correlated spatially to vaccination status? In fact it\u2019s the opposite",

Let's say January there was 30 deaths so the cumulative deaths in that time period are 30. In February there is 20 deaths so the cumulative deaths in that time period are 50.  In March there are 10 deaths, so the cumulative deaths over that time are 60.\n\nSo which month had worse numbers? Because the cumulative measure was lowest in January and highest in March.

It would be a slight fee for the cost of doing business to them. this whole thing with pharmaceutical companies profiting off of a healthcare crisis and botching the vaccines really reminds me of the big banks gambling with derivatives crashing the economy, and then being bailed out by the taxpayers in the end. It reminds me of tobacco, knowing that cigarettes cause cancer and hiding it for years, and never having to really pay a price for that. It also reminds me of oil companies re-branding themselves as energy companies because they knew about climate change and hid it from the public without ever having to pay a price for that.

On page 53:\n\n> Comparing state-level excess mortality percentage estimates to estimated COVID-19 vaccinated percentages shows a **moderate negative correlation** for both the U.S. population and the Group Life data for the third quarter of 2021. For subsequent periods, although some negative correlation was still seen in most periods, it was less pronounced than the third quarter of 2021. Note that Figure 9.21, which looks at the correlation based on the percent of the population with a completed primary vaccine series and an additional dose (booster) as of December 31, 2021, *shows a small positive correlation for the Group Life data for the 2022 period, but with a very low R2 statistic, **which indicates that vaccination rate does not explain much of the variation in excess mortality.***\n\nIn other words: The difference is clearly observable and substantial at the beginning in areas where there were more holdouts against getting the vaccine early on (you don\u2019t even need to plot a line to see it). Then, the difference shrinks as more people get the vaccine. Then it goes up at such a small rate that it can\u2019t even be seen in a graph without plotting a line and even then the line increases at such a small rate that it is not even clear that it is actually increasing due to factors being graphed. \n\nI don\u2019t know how much you remember from science classes but if you need to plot a line and there is not a significant change then that isn\u2019t evidence for anything.\n\nEdit: I just realized your comment makes it sound like the last graph wasn\u2019t the one they were talking about when they said it had a very small R^2. You should reread that section",

The higher the percentage of foreign DNA the higher the chance that you will have injuries or even fatalities because it can be shuttled into the nucleus of the cell since they used a plasmid and mRNA template. This isn\u2019t a vaccine, it\u2019s gene therapy. It has the potential to become a permanent fixture in your genetic makeup causing autoimmune issues that can potentially attack your organs and cause death. In the animal trials in a lot of labs who have worked with this type of technology they have died after being inoculated. Why this was the chosen method to use is beyond me. It\u2019s literally a poorly tested experiment from a corrupt and shoddy company that they pushed on the entire fucking world. The countries that did not allow Pfizer or Moderna to be part of the choices people could get probably faired better.

It\u2019s less than 10 per million - which is what you\u2019d expect to see happen after giving a candy bar to a million people because people are dying all the time. Less than 10 per million is not statistically significant. It\u2019s 0.00001%",

Let's just wait and see. Why do studies now to prevent this? Let's just see what happens. If people die, people die. Why prevent it?

Had heard that others in the same boat had gotten relief after being vaxxed. Caught it a second time about 7-8 months later. That time it was easier but did have new symptoms show up . Was vaxxed a second time about half a year later.

The number of CD3-positive T-cells by far outnumbered the few CD20-positive B-cells detected. In addition, most T-cells belonged to the CD4-positive subset, while only scattered CD8-positive T-cells were seen (Fig. 1, 2, Supplementary Fig. 1/2). The T cells were negative for Tbet as a marker for Th1 cells, GATA3 as a marker for Th2 cells, D2-40, as a marker for Th17 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, FOXP3 positive regulatory T cells and CD21 positive follicular dendritic cells were not detected within the cardiac infiltrates, while control cases, including cases of sarcoidosis were positive",

Low compliance and high compliance states and provinces show the same rise in Excess mortality.
