It\u2019s been this way since the beginning of time. Virtually every person in the US would be the most woke person in most places 100 years ago. My \u2018far right\u2019 mother in law certainly believes in women\u2019s right to vote, work, go to college, wear whatever they want, marry whomever they want, have legal rights without a husband, credit cards for women, her son is gay and she loves him and doesn\u2019t hide it, and yet she HATES the woke left. If this were 1923 she\u2019d be the most woke person in Kansas by far , but today she\u2019s a Trumper. The point is, it\u2019s always been like this and always will be. Old people hate change. Trust me, I\u2019m old. It\u2019s hard. I have a teenager. But my parents thought the same shit when I was in middle school.",

Many times has wokeness been called authoritarian, anybody that strays from the narrative gets a torrent of abuse. The confusing thing is that they say they stand for marginalised people and so on, which is not bad, the problem is the methods that they chose. Whenever you question them, you get called a rasist or transfobe, bc ofc they are antirasist by default, so then you must be rasist or whatever bad word, bc they are never wrong. A lot of the time it doesn't seem to be about the issues themselves, but about wielding power over others, cancellation is their favorite weapon. There was a podcast w a North Korean woman that studied at a American University, and she said the social presure to conform was just as bad at uni as in NK.",

She's been on a few podcasts in recent years, very interesting woman.\n\nThe cancel culture is a problem, bc people have stopped listening to anything that goes against their logic (this used to be a right-wing thing), so all they are left w is their dogma. Things like gender is on a spectrum. Ask a biologist if that's true, they will laugh at you, but then they will be cancelled. Striving to find the truth has become problematic, even w simple things. \n\nToxic masculinity is another, it started off as a description of certain types of really bad behaviour, but then slowly ballooned out to describe men in general. Men should just act more like women... the consequences of that is that young men don't approach women any more, bc ofc they don't want to be toxic. There's a whole list of problems that come w this.\n\nThere's the one where men and woman are the same, their are no sex differences. I'm always stunned when this has to explained. I still don't understand why people are so offended if men and woman are different. \n\nHow exactly this shapes and will shape young people, I don't have first hand experience, but from what I hear it's not good. Probably bc a lot of people have to lie to themselves to fit in.",

He quit at the end of August following a 20-year-career.\n\n>  'I was cancelled by 1,000 cuts. Academia should be about the advancement of knowledge but you're not allowed to advance theories which go against the progressive narrative. If you have a different viewpoint, you're in the crosshairs.\n\n> 'The climate at British universities has worsened because morally absolutist, often younger, illiberal progressives are using pressure, public reputational attacks and social media to limit academic freedom.\n\n> 'You've got to be in line with the orthodoxy, you can't deviate from dogma. It's an Orwellian threat to the enlightenment - free speech, equal treatment, due process, objective scientific truth.\n\n> He has faced:\n\n>  Social media pile ons, on Twitter, now X, organised by hostile students\n\n> An open letter to the Master of Birkbeck denouncing him and calling for him to be fired 'for his defence of white identity politics and his countless attacks against Black Lives Matter and other activists and scholars of colour on social media'\n\n>  Denunciations from a junior colleague who resigned because of the 'impact on Birkbeck staff and students of being in such close proximity to his [Professor Kaufmann's] far right followers' dragging him into an embarrassing media storm\n\n> A number of hostile student course evaluations and letters, which he believes were a coordinated attack, resulting in three damaging internal inquiries\n\nSo kind of similar in a way to how Elen de Generes had her show cancelled when she came out. All it is is people applying pressure. You might think it's ok. I think it's kind of scummy behaviour. Disagree with people by all means but let them live their lives.",
