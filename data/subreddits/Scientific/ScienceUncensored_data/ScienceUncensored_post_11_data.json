In details, pyrvinium acts through the following main mechanisms: (i) energy and autophagy depletion; and (ii) inhibition of Akt and Wnt-\u03b2-catenin-dependent pathways.*\n\n\nPyrvinium  could apparently work against additional cancers, than just stomach cancer. BTW It just happens that Ivermectin - a drug, which is also a dewormer - was recently found to have anticancer activity too. Pyrvinium is chemically close to hydroxychloroquine though (which is also a quinolinium derivative), but hydroxychloroquine doesn't lack anticancer activity also.\n\n* [Pyrvinium selectively induces apoptosis of lymphoma cells through impairing mitochondrial functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X15310640)\n* [Repurposing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as anti-cancer agents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5718030/)\n* [Ivermectin Kills Prostate Cancer Cells](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/10rlcam/ivermectin_kills_prostate_cancer_cells/), [Ivermectin converts cold tumors hot for treatment of breast cancer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/zo3b6n/ivermectin_converts_cold_tumors_hot_for_treatment/)",
