Should those people go to jail too? \n\nI've said it again and again - the Jan 6 insurgency is *exactly* what people loved about Twitter for so long - organizing people to challenge the government. When Twitter users organized protests on it for Euromaidan, it was hailed as a massive win. \n\nBut then when it was used against the American government by people you and I don't agree with, suddenly it should be illegal to talk about there. \n\nAll you have to do is picture that tool in the hands of someone you don't agree with, and it suddenly becomes *very* questionable.",

Some people have always been like that, of course, but things really sped up in the 1980s. The Shareholder primacy doctrine which pretty much says companies should be sociopaths and do anything to increase profits has really just enabled our worst tendancies.... but ultimately, it is the widespread corruption of our society that prevents us all from solving it. This is the first sickness in our society that Facebook exploits. \n\nThe second sickness in our society that Facebook exploits is the weakness of the people in general. Mental health, the ability to distinguish truth from lies, or good from bad, selfishness from good.... and this is the type sickness that Facebook and others have purposely fed and nurtured and grown exponentially so they can make money.",

Corporations used to be seen to have a duty to not only the country, but their communities and their workers and customers.

Now it has gone even further, especially with social media companies.. the process is called 'enshitification' where first they attract users, then they abandon the user experience for advertisers, then they abandon the advertisers (their real customers) so they can maximize the money they make. Like they just become awful at everything except making themselves money... and only give the users and advertisers just enough that they keep coming back so the company can exploit both of them.",

These accounts represent users who are clearly political in nature, discussing politics almost exclusively. They consist largely of anonymous hyperpartisan accounts but also high-profile political pundits and strategists. Notably, this group includes the official accounts of both the Democratic and Republican parties (@TheDemocrats\u00a0and\u00a0u/GOP), as well as\u00a0u/DonaldJTrumpJr, the account of the son and political advisor of then-President Donald Trump.\n\n>The next largest group is the \u201cother\u201d category, making up 14 active accounts (13.4%). This group mostly consists of nano-influencers with a moderate following (median \u2248 14 thousand followers) posting about various topics. A few accounts were classified in this group simply because their tweets were in a different language.\n\n>The \u201cmedia outlet\u201d and \u201cmedia affiliated\u201d classifications make up the next two largest groups, consisting of 19 active accounts combined (18.3%). Most of the media outlets and media affiliated accounts are associated with low-credibility sources. For example,\u00a0[Breaking911.com](http://Breaking911.com)\u00a0is a low-credibility source and the\u00a0u/Breaking911\u00a0account was identified as a superspreader.

Extending this analysis to include other hyperpartisan accounts (i.e., those classified as a different type but still posting hyperpartisan content), 91% of accounts (63 of 69) are categorized as conservative.",

Abortion was largely fixed on as a uniting issue for the elements of the right that had lost the anti-segregation fight but wanted to continue to push their agenda. It was private Christian schools that were (and still are) the last vestige of formal segregation and which also are core constituencies for the hard right. Evangelical, Pentecostal, and Charismatic church members are the most likely to support Trump of almost any demographic.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that the anti-abortion crowd and the anti-trans crowd are the same crowd: they are fundamentally opposed to the concept of bodily autonomy for anyone other than wealthy straight white Christian men, because their core political commitment is to the maintenance of racial, class, gender, and religious hierarchies.\n\n>Not to mention that liberals support plenty of laws that restrict bodily autonomy\n\nOf course they do. Traditional American liberals and conservatives are just somewhat different tendencies within the same broad political current. Liberals are hierarchical too, they just like to conceal it more and they're not quite as openly sadistic about it. They don't have that many fundamental political disagreements with conservatives, they just tend to have one or more identities that conservatives are openly hostile to and which therefore mostly exclude them from ascendancy within the Republican movement. They still want hierarchies for the most part, just not the hierarchies that would hurt them specifically.",
