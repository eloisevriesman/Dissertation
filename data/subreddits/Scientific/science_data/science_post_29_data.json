The viral genes have unusual activity levels in people who have a higher genetic risk of experiencing these mental health conditions, a study has found.\n\nRetroviruses are a large group of viruses whose life cycle involves inserting their genetic information into the DNA of their host. Remnants of such viral genes can be seen in the DNA of many animal species, and these sequences are called human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) when found in the human genome.\n\nUntil recently, most HERVs were thought to remain dormant and were called \u201cfossil viruses\u201d. But previous studies have suggested that some of the viral genes may in fact be active \u2013 although not producing infectious viruses \u2013 and may even play a role in neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis\n\n  \nIn a new study, Timothy Powell at King\u2019s College London and his colleagues investigated the possible role of these viral remnants in mental health conditions by looking at viral proteins in nearly 800 brains that had been donated for medical research.\n\nWhile the team didn\u2019t record if any of the donors had been diagnosed with mental health conditions while alive, they found that some genetic variants that are known to raise the risks of depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were associated with altered activity of genes from five different HERVs.\n\n  \n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48153-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48153-z)",
