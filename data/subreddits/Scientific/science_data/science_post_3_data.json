These cues include both facial features and written content that suggest a higher likelihood of sexual aggression. Interestingly, typical online dating safety recommendations appear to have little effect on enhancing women\u2019s sensitivity to these threat-related cues.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many social issues, including domestic and sexual violence against women. Reports of increased domestic violence and emergency shelter requests surged during lockdowns, and misogynistic behaviors also rose significantly. Online dating platforms, which saw increased usage during this period, present additional risks for women. These platforms can facilitate encounters with men prone to sexual aggression, making it crucial to understand how women identify and respond to threat cues in these contexts.",

Angled brows and smaller eyes are associated with glaring. Likewise, thinly pressed lips are associated with coldness or displeasure. The overall effect combines to present a picture of contempt and displeasure, with a higher potential for aggression and unempathetic behavior.\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, these traits are not passive ones like eye color, they require a degree of active maintenance to uphold as they require the contraction of muscles to achieve, so they're seen as more reflective of the man's personality or at least his general emotional baseline.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's not a perfect method of course, and some unfortunate individuals appear to be displeased when they aren't. I will say in a lot of pictures of people who supposedly have these facial features are still engaging their muscles such as furrowing their brows. So even if they don't think they're in a bad mood, for whatever reason they're still engaging muscles associated with aggression.\u00a0",
