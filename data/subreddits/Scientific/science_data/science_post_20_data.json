            "body": "From the article: Therapies that deliver electrical stimulation to the brain to treat neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s have been found to be effective. To deliver this deep brain stimulation (DBS), electrodes are implanted in areas of the brain through small holes drilled in the skull. A pacemaker-like device is also inserted under the skin of the chest to power the electrodes.\n\nInserting electrodes into the brain has risks, one being that the leads carrying those electrodes can be misplaced, migrate, or break. Researchers from the Uhlan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), South Korea, have developed a biodegradable, wirelessly activated \u2018bio-paper\u2019 implant that avoids these issues.\n\n\u201cThe developed material offers personalized treatment options tailored to individual needs and physical characteristics, simplifying treatment processes, enhancing flexibility, and versatility in electrical stimulation-based clinical applications,\u201d said the [study\u2019s](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202311154) lead author, Jun Kyu Choe, from UNIST\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Engineering.",
