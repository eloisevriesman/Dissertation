These traits can significantly impact mental health and interpersonal relationships, leading to various social and personal difficulties. Narcissistic Personality Disorder, the more extreme manifestation, affects about 1% to 15% of the U.S. population in clinical settings and presents a unique challenge in mental health care due to its complex and overlapping symptoms with other personality disorders.\n\nDespite the prevalence of narcissistic traits and NPD, research into their neurological underpinnings remains limited. Existing studies primarily focus on either gray or white matter separately and often use univariate methods that do not account for the complex interactions within the brain. This study aimed to fill this gap by examining the joint contributions of both gray and white matter to narcissistic traits using multivariate machine learning approaches.\n\n\u201cIn the Clinical and Affective Neuroscience Lab, we are interested in creating neuro-predictive models of personality to serve as future guidance for clinical classification and prevention of the development of a full disease. Personality is the heart of who we are. However, our understanding of the neural bases of personality and how personality can be predicted from neural features is something far to be understood. In our lab we are trying to pave the way to reach this aim,\u201d said study author Alessandro Grecucci, a professor of affective neuroscience and neurotechnology at the University of Trento.",
