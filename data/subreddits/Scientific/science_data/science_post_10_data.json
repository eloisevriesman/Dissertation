The sample size, as the other person mentioned, for the group that initially identified as cisgender and later identified as trans/gender diverse was low, so the difference in depression scores was on the edge of significance anyway (P=0.03), and getting above significance at 0.05 wouldn\u2019t need that much change. The violence did account for a meaningful amount of the increased depression, but we do not have evidence to say the increased depression actually disappeared. Something being statistically insignificant does NOT imply that there actually is not a real difference. It just means the study couldn\u2019t find one, which may be purely due to design.",

Cumulative violence was not isolated.\n\nEdit: formatting",
