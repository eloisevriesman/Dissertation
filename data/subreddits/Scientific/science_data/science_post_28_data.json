That's just a throwing the microwave kind of thing. Onions are good too. Peppers. Apples, oranges navels\n\n All of these things are very high in fiber. The whole grains you can eat like a cereal. You can just munch on it during the day. I personally prefer to eat mine with the keto yogurt that they sell at Walmart best yogurt that I've ever had, but I just put two spoonfuls of yogurt mix it on the grains.
