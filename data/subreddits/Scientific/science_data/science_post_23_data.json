Wouldn't prove that current microplastic levels are deleterious per se, but would strongly suggest it. It would also clarify what kinds of disease are correlated with microplastics exposure. Such a study would almost certainly be deemed unethical and impractical though, so I think we're stuck with mouse studies for the time being.",

This study tries to minimize the risk of contamination from lab sourced microplastics and does have some samples with no plastic detected, which is encouraging.

My bad.\n\nAs per your linked article: \n\n>3.4.2. Thrombosis\nThrombosis is considered a significant cardiovascular risk factor attributable to blood vessel occlusion (Hirase and Node, 2012, Rao, 2015). A recent review comprehensively discussed the size- dependent influence of MNPs on thrombosis with focus on how the particle characteristics modulate their effects (Lett et al., 2021). Exposing hamsters intravenously or intratracheally to PS-NPs (60 nm; 5\u2013500 \u00b5g/kg) with different surface modifications resulted in various thrombotic events (Nemmar et al., 2002). Intravenous injection of amine-PS-NPs enhanced thrombus formation at 50 \u00b5g/kg (+219%) and 500 \u00b5g/kg (+307%), while carboxylate-PS-NPs injection decreased thrombus formation at 100 \u00b5g/kg (\u201352%) and 500 \u00b5g/kg (\u201355%) **and unmodified particles did not significantly affect thrombosis**. Furthermore, amine-PS-NPs substantially increased the adenosine diphosphate-triggered platelet aggregation, whereas both unmodified and carboxylate-PS-NPs only led to a moderate increase **and no prothrombotic response** (Nemmar et al., 2002, 2003). In a noninvasive ear vein model of Fisher 344 rats, intravenously administered amine-PS-NPs (60 nm; 0.02\u201350 mg/kg) caused thrombogenesis **but carboxylate-PS-NPs did not** (Silva et al., 2005). Another human venous blood study showed both carboxylate- and amine-polystyrene latex nanoparticles (PLNPs, 50 nm; 260\u2013750 \u00b5g/mL) caused platelet aggregation (McGuinnes et al., 2011). Carboxylate-PLNPs were shown to increase the expression of CD62P and PAC-1 (platelet biomarkers) in both the whole blood and the isolated platelet, **whereas unmodified and amine-PLNPs did not**. McGuinnes et al. (2011) suggested that the amine-PS-NP-induced platelet aggregation was primarily membrane perturbation-mediated. For example, injecting unmodified or amine-PLNPs (50 nm; 1.2 \u00b5g/animal) into C57BL6 **mice did not induce platelet aggregation** per se, however, administration of collagen (50 \u00b5g/kg) following amine-PLNPs treatment facilitated a prothrombotic response (Smyth et al., 2015). Amine-MNPs have a more robust aggregation ability and interact with negatively charged biomolecules (e.g., cell membranes). **Overall, the prothrombotic effects of MNPs are dependent on surface modification, particle size, exposure dose, exposure route, and protein presence.** MNPs with altered surface modifications arise out of the most vital role in thrombosis and platelet aggregation.\n\ne.g. a mixed bag of results.  Some MPs at some sizes increased thrombosis, and some did not.  More than anything, surface modifications to the MPs appear to be triggering factor rather the the MP itself.\n\n>3.4.3. Affecting blood coagulation\nBlood coagulation can be initiated by either intrinsic or extrinsic pathways, and it culminates in thrombus formation after cascade reactions (Norris and Med, 2003). MNPs may disrupt the balance between pro- and anticoagulant pathways at molecular levels. In human plasma, amine-PS-NPs (57 and 330 nm; 0.06\u20130.5 mg/mL) bound to FVII and FIX as the upstream factors in the extrinsic pathway, **and this decreased thrombin generation** (Oslakovic et al., 2012). In contrast, carboxylate-PS-NPs (24 and 220 nm; 0.5 mg/mL) activated coagulation by intrinsic pathway, and sulfonated PS-NPs (23 and 200 nm; 0.5 mg/mL) with negative charges **affected neither intrinsic nor extrinsic pathways**. At the same mass concentration, 57 nm amine-PS-NPs showed stronger effects on thrombin generation than 330 nm amine-PS-NPs, due to significantly higher numbers of smaller particles and/or the greater surface-to-volume ratio of smaller particles (Oslakovic et al., 2012). In zebrafish, exposing to PE-NPs (191.10 \u00b1 3.13 nm; 25\u2013200 \u00b5g/mL) resulted vascular endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulable state of circulating blood further accelerated thrombosis (Sun et al., 2021). MNPs can regulate blood coagulation through various mechanisms, largely dependent on particle size and surface modification. When MNPs encounter blood through an open wound, the effects on blood coagulation may have clinical significance.\n\ne.g. again, a mixed bag of results with some sizes, dosages, and modifications up regulating and some down regulating the various pathways, or having no effect at all.\n\nAnd overall, (and as mentioned by the study AND me above), it's entirely possible these effects are due in no small part to inflammation.  MPs that trigger inflammation create in vivo conditions conducive to coagulation.  \n\ne.g. rather than MPs/NPs *directly* causing clotting, SOME MPs/NPs create conditions where clotting may occur.\n\nI would not call causing inflammation the same thing as causing clotting, more a risk factor.",

It addresses the lack of comprehensive research on the effects of microplastic size and surface modification on clotting dynamics in human whole blood. Thromboelastography was used to examine aminated (aPS), carboxylated (cPS), and non-functionalized (nPS) polystyrene particles with sizes of 50, 100, and 500 \u2009nm. Results show that cPS consistently activated the clotting cascade, demonstrating increased fibrin polymerization rates, and enhanced clot strength in a size and concentration-dependent manner. nPS had minimal effects on clotting dynamics except for 50\u2009 nm particles at the lowest concentration. The clotting effects of aPS (100\u2009 nm particles) resembled those of cPS but were diminished in the 500\u2009 nm aPS group. These findings emphasize the importance of microplastic surface modification, size, concentration, and surface area on in-vitro whole blood clotting dynamics.",

If you don't, your profits go down and your competitors get an advantage over you, so even if you are trying to do the right thing, you might not be able to do it for long.\n\nBut if we put a tax on single-use non-biodegradable products so that the cost to use them is comparable or more expensive than the non-biodegradable versions, the economics would change and now everyone would have an incentive to use them. You wouldn't need crazy regulations or enforcement mechanisms because you could tax them at the point of sale. In cases where it still makes sense for some reason to use non-biodegradable versions, people still could as long as they were willing to pay for it.

The pacific garbage patch and ubiquitous microplastics aren't caused by litterbugs. And it matters even less if we're talking about a country with 'good waste management'. That litterbug's trash is getting vacuumed up by a street cleaner. Or it is going into the sewer and getting filtered out before the water goes back into a waterway.\n\n>The next challenge will have to be met with a different strategy.

But the problem with that is, how do you know? Some of these problems we never even consider until they exist. How do you analyze the effects of producing 100 billion of a product? A Tupperware all by itself doesn't actually have any detrimental effects. The problem only comes from dumping tons and tons and tons and tons of it into dumps and the oceans. Are we really expecting the people that invented plastic to analyze the extent countries break international treaty to dump waste illegally?\n\nAnd are we really expecting them to do that when the alternative is just not having a waste management system that consists primarily of dumping garbage into the environment?",

Even if you buy yogurt in glasses etc, there is always plastic somewhere, for example inside the lid. Meat is always vacuumed in plastic bags, before they unwrap it and sell it at the market. It was expensive and difficult and my grocery bags were so heavy from the glass. I think we are in urgent need of a climate friendly possibility to wrap and store food that doesn't contain plastic and is less heavy than glass. For some people glass is also dangerous (diseases with tremors etc). But yeah what I wanted to say - avoiding plastic in food is really really difficult",

The microplastic levels in human thrombi have a positive correlation with the severity of ischemic strokes.\n\nOf the 30 thrombi acquired from patients with myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, or ischemic stroke, 24 (80%) contained microplastics. The median concentration of microplastics in the thrombi from myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, or ischemic stroke cases was 141.80 \u03bcg/g, 69.62 \u03bcg/g, and 61.75 \u03bcg/g, respectively.\n\nThe major polymers identified in the microplastics retrieved from thrombi were polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polyamide 66. Laser direct infrared spectroscopy also revealed that of the 15 types of microplastics identified, polyethylene was the most dominant, having a diameter of 35.6 micrometers and constituting 53.6% of all microplastics retrieved. The microplastics were heterogeneous in size.\n\nThe D-dimer levels, one of the hypercoagulability biomarkers that indicate the increased risk of thrombotic events, were significantly higher in groups in which microplastics were detected in the thrombi, as compared to the groups in which microplastics were not detected. This suggested a direct link between microplastic concentrations in the body and the risk of thrombotic events.\n\nConclusions\nOverall, the study found that thrombi retrieved from major blood vessels of patients with myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or deep vein thrombosis contain significant concentrations of microplastics of varying polymer types and physical properties. Furthermore, the risk of thrombotic events and disease severity increases with increasing levels of microplastics.\n\n  \n[https://www.news-medical.net/news/20240522/Study-finds-microplastics-in-blood-clots-linking-them-to-higher-risk-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes.aspx](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20240522/Study-finds-microplastics-in-blood-clots-linking-them-to-higher-risk-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes.aspx)",

You can't then link microplastics to thrombotic events, since there is no control group. Your title and subsequent summary are incorrect.\n\nAll the study found was that some patients had microplastics in their blood.",

It's everywhere and has been for a human lifespan.\n\nThat raises the question: Does finding it mean anything if it's everywhere? Where is the sample of people who did not need clots removed? They almost certainly have microplastics too. How much? More? Less? Without that data, you can draw no conclusions, and you certainly can't make a \"link\".\n\n/edit\n\nWhen I was a kid, my dad installed an motion activated light by out back door. After that, the light would come on almost every night to reveal racoons. Clearly, automatic lights attract racoons.\n\nLater, as the racoons got bolder, they would sometimes knock over our garbage cans. If you looked at the spilled garbage, there was plastic in in. Therefore.....\n\nEdit: Apparently, I have been seen as defending the microplastic boogey man. BOOO!!!\n\nThis study says it found microplastics in clots, just like I found plastic in the tipped over garbage. If microplastics are everywhere (which they are) then you're going to find it everywhere. post hoc ergo propter hoc.\n\nYou will also find microplastic inside the bodies of centenarians. That doesn't mean that microplastics are longevity treatments.\n\nThis is interesting, but proves nothing about a \"link\" to anything. If you understand logic, you'd see that.",
