That means a human would have to take a minimum of 12 **grams** of UA per day to see the same effects. You\u2019d have to eat 29.7 kg of strawberries or 16.9 kg of raspberries per day to get the same dosage (H\u00e4kkinen et al 2000).",

This means that the brain has difficulties removing weak mitochondria, which thus accumulate and affect brain function. If you are able to stimulate the mitophagy process, removing weak mitochondria, you will see some very positive results,\u201d Vilhelm Bohr explains.\n>\n>The results of the new study show that a substance found in pomegranates, urolithin A, removes weak mitochondria from the brain just as effectively as NAD supplement.\n\nPaper: [Urolithin A improves Alzheimer's disease cognition and restores mitophagy and lysosomal functions - Hou - Alzheimer's & Dementia - Wiley Online Library](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13847)",
