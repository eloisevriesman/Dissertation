On the other hand, cannabis product variety exploded after state-legalization. Vapes, dabs, edibles, tinctures, \u0394-8-tetrahydrocannabinol and other intoxicating products derived from industrial hemp create the possibility that some cannabis users might answer \u2018no\u2019 to questions asking only about traditional \u2018marijuana and hashish\u2019 \\[11\\]. Therefore, measurement error in an indeterminate direction is possible.",

(sorry for wall of text) \n\nWow, really? I think I understand the sentiment, but my observations have been than the decriminalization of marijuana has had positive effects. In some states that have legalized it, use among teens has declined. Its legalization has led to more scientific research into it, and normalization of discourse around it. I do support its legal status, but that doesn't mean that I'd recommend it for everyone. Like anything intoxicating, it's use should be approached carefully and intelligently.\n\nI've seen that people seem to be having more adult conversations about the consequences of regular and occasional marijuana use. What I've seen is that the people I know who used it prior to legalization still do, and those who didn't use it prior to legalization still don't. I have several friends with kids in high school and college, and none of them use it with any regularity--most, not at all. \n\nI'm 57 now, and smoked occasionally in my 20s. In my late 20s, its effect on need changed markedly, and I stopped using it. I live in Maine, a state where it's legal, and its legal status hasn't affected consumption in  anyone I know. Thinking about it, a few of my friends have stopped completely.\n\nI've suffered from anxiety disorders since early childhood. Several years ago my gf encouraged me to try cannabis for it, and I said no way--it can make anxiety much worse. After a couple years of reading about its medicinal efficacy, I started experimenting with very low, controlled dosages--less than the amount necessary to feel high. I was incredibly surprised that it's been very effective at helping me with anxiety and depression. After being very skeptical about the reality of \"medical\" marijuana use, I've learned that it has been incredibly, amazingly helpful for me and a few others I know. I wouldn't eat or smoke a \"recreational\" dose any more than I'd take a handful of Tylenol.\n\nCarefully dosed THC edibles have helped me more than 35+ years of antidepressants & anxiety meds ever did, and with fewer unpleasant side effects. I have constant pain from spinal stenosis, gout, and arthritis. THC has been the only thing I've found that helps me sleep through the night.\n\nI do feel that it should be legal, and I also feel that it should be regulated and controlled rationally, just like the other five medications I take. It does lend itself to abuse in some people. I don't think it's a magical cure for anything, but it has made my life a lot easier and less unpleasant. Its efficacy in people with severe seizure disorders is just astounding.",

Both exist but none are that common. \n\nLast I checked about 1-2 per 100.000 is expected to experience a suspected drug induced psychosis. That\u2019s not that much considering how common the association between the two are.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure alcohol induced paranoia would be pretty common too if it was illegal. Being under suspicion when your under the influence of any drug would probably have that effect.\nIt\u2019s certainly more common to be a danger to other people when drunk. People are just used to that. So they don\u2019t fear it.",

There are people that have given up drinking alcohol socially now that they can grab THC drinks when out at a taproom with friends. Some of them are seriously tasty!\n\nIf you haven't tried a modern seltzer, give'm a shot. They don't taste like oily weed like the old drinks did.",

My biggest obstacle is the wide range of misconceptions I developed growing up, either from poorly taught lessons or from the wacky stuff my dad made up about the world. It's frustratingly difficult trying to learn about something when all the information you're learning is seemingly at odds with the version of the facts you know, and for me it was becoming more and more difficult to accept the new information. \n\nOnce I started learning while under the influence, I became much more interested in learning the subject matter in proper sequence and it was like all the new information became so obvious, which allowed me to let my misconceptions dissolve and fade. So not only was I learning but I was simultaneously having intense sessions of self reflection about why I was so attached to these ideas and facts that were so obviously incorrect. I'm not sure exactly what this experience can be categorized as, but the influence cannabis had on me truly allowed me to open up my mind and see the information as the truth about the world, rather than just information that I'm supposed to know. \n\nNowadays, that re-wiring of my mind stays with me even if I haven't consumed any cannabis in weeks, but I wouldn't have ever gotten myself here without a couple years of frequent indulgence. Learning is only a small aspect of its influence on me. Learning, love, life, self, humanity and its physical and societal evolution, empathy, stewardship, the embracing of everyone and everything around me regardless of the perception of fault- these are subjects that consume my mind when I am under the influence and it's a journey that's an absolute joy.",

They're really convenient and take most of the hassle out of the job.\n\nThere are a few devices on the market. I have one that decarboxylates the cannabis in a separate heating cycle that you run before infusion. Decarboxylation activates the dominant form of THC in the flower, breaking down THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) into THC that your body can absorb.\n\nThe machine itself will be a bit pricy, probably, but you will end up much healthier than if you smoked, and even a bit healthier than if you used a dry-herb vape. And you will recoup the cost slowly by using less flower. If you have a dry-herb vape, you can save up the already-vaped-bud (AVB) and make oil with that - it will have about 1/4 to 1/3 of the THC of the original flower.",

They ran down the full list, did all kinds of tests, and... nothing. Just a heart attack with no blockage of any kind, no obvious cause. This is why I say to take it seriously.

We also know that THC processed through the liver is different than THC inhaled. Smoking also contains more compounds than just THC. Ideally, I would like to see if they can reproduce the same results with pure THC ingested through the digestive system. I'm not saying the results would be different BUT it would go a long ways to ensuring it's actually THC and not some other compound activated through smoking.\n\nI ordered some genestein, couldn't hurt...",

Both are mandatory for both sexes and are required for a lot more than promoting sex characteristics. \n\nA man with no estrogen would be extremely unhealthy, have no sex drive, brittle bones, etc.  You need estrogen to live. And in males increases estrogen is usually followed by natural increases to testosterone to balance things. \n\nFairly large fluctuations in sex hormones are normal.  Testosterone for example can be several times it's base line at certain points, and can be several times less at other points in a day or month. Your body is designed to compensate for them, to the extent that the small effects from phytoestrogens have never been proven to have any measurable impact on sex characteristics, mood, testosterone, or estrogen levels.\n\nWeakling activating does not mean you end up with more over all because the system is more complex and more interacting than that. Lots of things activate hormone production. This is why people need to understand the science behind things before they confidently believe or repeat things like this.",

These interactions make it difficult to determine the exact role of cannabis use in causing psychosis that may not have otherwise occurred.\n\n> Regardless, the connection between cannabis use and psychosis is not surprising. There is a strong resemblance between the acute and transient effects of cannabis use and symptoms of psychosis, including impaired memory, cognition and processing of external stimuli. This combines to make it hard for a person to learn and remember new things but can also extend to the experience of deluded thinking and hallucinations.\n\nhttps://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/blog/does-cannabis-cause-mental-illness",

And at no time does this suggest that any margin of error establishment was attempted since the surveys started. \n\nAlso I would need to see the exact question asked in regard to both. While probably not a common variance someone may report not drinking alcohol if all they had was a seltzer like a truly or white claw. In their minds alcohol might be more connotative with a mixed drink or straight shot of whiskey, vodka, tequila, and so on depending on the environment they grew up in. \n\nSelf reporting ultimately relies on honesty which  perspective, shame, and cultural norms can affect.",
