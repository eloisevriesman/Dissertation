Science journalists - especially ones tailored towards mass consumption - necessarily use less precise language than the scientists themselves use, and terms like \"general acceptance\" is always going to be a nebulous thing.  If you want more particular language to describe what's actually been found, I'd recommend delving into the studies and the actual papers where this stuff was released.",

I'm sure the primary literature is out there somewhere, but I won't try to interpret it since I'm not an astronomer.\n\nI do think you're expecting more certainty from science than you're ever going to get, though. There's no beacon of truth that lights up when you hit the \"right\" answer. All we have are the results of our experiments and observations. Even on Earth, we're stumbling in the dark. The theories that stand up to repeated testing again and again are more likely to be true.\n\nGiven all that uncertainty, it's honestly pretty impressive we've gotten this far!",
