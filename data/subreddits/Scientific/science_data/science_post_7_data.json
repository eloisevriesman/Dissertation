The first time I got my medication after diagnosis at 23 years old, I literally was able to make myself get in the shower for the first time in days and broke down sobbing at how it felt like my mind actually began to re-sort itself. Like, this was how everybody else felt? Hot damn no wonder I struggled so much, and it was incredible and amazing and infuriating and very sorrowful at the same time that I actually had been held back so much.\n\nIt's very normal from my own anecdotal experiences in support groups for us sometimes to have a backpedal of sorts when it comes to dealing with the return of symptoms. A lot of doctors will claim it is withdrawal (and it can be for some, I don't want to discount that) but it's a very natural effect of realizing that yes, your safety net helps you get by and is incredible, but you do need it and that can be very hard to wrap your head around - you're not like everybody else that can just continue to be the same if you forget your medicine. Those worthless feelings of stupidity and rejection sensitive can come back really hard in those moments. Just continue to be there - it's all you can do.\n\nI also don't know if hormones are the same, but people assigned female at birth can really have trouble with dips in hormones and the effectiveness of their medication during those times. If you notice during puberty that he is really struggling or it seems the medicine is less effective, it may be worth talking to his doctor about. There are supportive medications that can help increase or balance the effects of the main prescription and it's a tricky game to get it right, but it's so worth it to discover the most normalcy our brains will allow us",

I don\u2019t have sources on hand, but I suggest you look into it because it is very interesting and the data isn\u2019t hard to find. This is in no way suggesting that every diagnosis of BPD or bipolar disorder is actually just undiagnosed autism, but it does happen.

You have things that will be highly selective in some environments but not in others that then don't face any penalty once they are out of that environment. For example, being relatively hairless would've been quite beneficial to us in Africa but not so much in Scandinavia, but it wasn't bad enough that we became a furry species again. \n\nAlso, most evolutionary hypotheses like these don't have a huge amount of evidence because they're pretty difficult to directly test, and so those with understanding of theory come up with ideas which can later be tested.",

It lists several studies. It's seems untrue to suggest that there isn't any evidence when those articles link to studies to say they're even finding higher incidence of ADHD linked genes in nomadic tribes that still survive today.\n\n[In this article there's a table](https://www.londonpsychiatry.clinic/blog/hunter-gatherers-to-modern-biohackers) that lists all the traits of ADHD and the hypothesized benefit they would have given hunter gatherers. Plus how modern sufferers of ADHD use it to their advantage, as long as they're not working 9-5 \"Farmer\" type jobs.",

It is not just a \"can't concentrate in school.\" People with ADHD oftentimes have profound social difficulties. For example:\n\n* ADHD impulsivity shows up as talking over others, impatience, blurting out inappropriate things etc. The ADHD child displays all these behaviors and no one wants to play with her and she struggles to make friends. \n\n* ADHD BF struggles with task completion due to time blindness, forgetfulness, etc. The GF has asked the ADHD BF multiple times to complete tasks but he has been unable to. Whenever the GF gets mad at the ADHD BF he has big emotional reactions (ADHD can lead to emotional dysregulation). This pattern of behavior leads to increased stress on both of them. \n\n* ADHD wife is impulsive and whenever she is tasked with going shopping she will forget the list. On top of this she will fall victim to impulse purchases that eat away at the family finances. \n\nThese are all things I have witnessed as a psychologist. ADHD is more than just school/work based difficulties. It affects the whole functioning of the individual. Blaming modern systems minimizes the true impact of this disability.",

Almost always I ended up being friends with the weird kids. As I got older and learned the above, I started to \u201cspot\u201d people with ADHD. If I knew the person well enough and their symptoms were obvious enough I would guess that they had it and ask them in a nonchalant way if they\u2019d ever been diagnosed. So far I\u2019m 5/5. I try to keep an open mind too cause I think I\u2019m a better masker than the average adhd and it would take someone skilled to recognize me, so I think it goes under the radar for a lot of people, especially inattentive types. \n\nReason I\u2019m bringing this up, I still have this \u201cfeeling\u201d if someone is \u201cweird\u201d or not. That weirdness can split out into a lot of things, but specifically for adhd there is no way it is 40% of the population. Primarily because the majority of people I meet are not weird or don\u2019t give off behaviors of having a different type of mind. Otherwise also, me and my friends would not have felt this socially isolated my whole life if it was 40%.",

So many people who manage to cobble together a system of coping mechanisms to work through it and still be outwardly \"successful\" can go undiagnosed for a very long time. For myself, I have always had an intrinsic interest in things like science, math, reading, history, and so on, precisely the sort of things that would allow me to do well (with some caveats) within the educational system and even in the workplace (also with some caveats). The old public perception of what someone with ADHD looked like was nothing like my experience, so it didn't seem to apply, until I started seeing accounts of what ADHD was really like from other folks who were dealing with it.\n\nSay what you want about social media, but the last 20 years or so have been an incredible time for people to share their own accounts of their experiences and their \"conditions\" which has helped a ton of people learn more about themselves.",

I've always been a public school person, but my son will be going to a private montessori school next year as my own personal experiment in hypocrisy - I still think public schools are critically important for society, but they may not be the right thing for my kid at this point in his life. I feel guilty about it, but I'd also feel guilty if I were keeping him in a system where he comes home saying he hates math in 1st grade. He's too young to hate math and reading. (And his parents are a math-adjacent professor and a nuclear engineer, so we just can't handle him hating math when he's been interested in it since he was 2.)\n\nThe problem with the educational system is that it takes a lot more resources to do it well than we currently dedicate (and the resources need to be spent in the right places and not on admin salaries). Part of the problem is that schools can't fix the wider societal ills - they can't overcome poverty, neglect, lack of support, and so on, though they are an important safety net in a lot of ways. As a college professor, I'm sure I see things with a very particular bias, but it seems that because we're using metrics about passing rates, students aren't allowed to fail very often. Failure is a good thing, sometimes - it helps to see the consequences of failure so that you can avoid it in the future, and failing in \"safe\" ways is a good way to vaccinate against anxiety, too. The way we have set the system up post NCLB ensures that kids won't be allowed to fail because teachers and principles are evaluated based on failure rates. I'm all for evaluating teachers and principles, fwiw, but I think using that particular metric is a problem, because metrics become targets and optimization produces bad, systemic consequences.",

You are focused entirely on supporting your argument with category characteristics. Let\u2019s destroy that argument together.\n\nEverything you are discussing as negatives are equivalent arguments to someone being left handed. Higher rates of injury. Worse productivity.\u00a0In a 2009 study of children 11 and younger, Australian researchers found that left-handed kids performed worse than right-handers several measures, including vocabulary, reading, writing, social development, and gross and fine motor skills.\u00a0People who are left-handed are at greater risk of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, according to a 2013 Yale University study. When researchers polled patients at a mental-health clinic, 40% of those with schizophrenia or schizoaffective said they wrote with their left hand.\u00a0Left-handedness seems to be associated with some physical health issues. In a 2007 study published in the British Journal of Cancer, researchers found that left-handers had a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handers.\u00a0\n\nIsn\u2019t it interesting that every argument you\u2019re making parallels the problems with being left handed, including the dramatic ones around hurting themselves and others, and yet you still double down on the idea that there is something disabled in having a brain that doesn\u2019t conform to the majority system.\n\nDon\u2019t you think there might be something worth looking at there? Isn\u2019t it the least bit interesting that we don\u2019t call left handed people disabled, because the equivalence to ADHD is unavoidable and really obliterates the clarity of your argument and position.\n\nThe reason people call it a disability is *cultural* and not *scientific*. It\u2019s evolutionarily advantageous that it exists or it wouldn\u2019t exist, and we *really don\u2019t know why*. So, do you trust psychology over biology? Is that why it\u2019s important to call it a disability? Or is it society that lacks empathy and equity for minority brain types, just as it does for most other minority types? If 1 in 5 isn\u2019t enough to warrant a reexamination of \u201cnormal,\u201d as I asked in the beginning, what percentage of people would be? 25%? 49%? 51%? When would the current dominant brain in the population become abnormal exactly? From an evolutionary standpoint? And would you call it a disability? Or just a minority?",

I am pointing out that there are genuinely strongly negative traits that are generally unrelated to the nature of modern industrial society. They aren't to do with 9 to 5 jobs, or having to sit still in schools. Or whatever other cultural aspect there is.\n\nI'm aware there are positives. But that's not relevant to the point I'm making. \n\n>People who are left-handed are at greater risk of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, according to a 2013 Yale University study.

That's not good for your argument, that's bad.\n\nI previously thought that left handedness was neutral, and all negative outcomes were just due to society not designing for left handed (higher clumsiness, injuries, worse motor performance all understandable for a right handed society).\n\nThis confirms to my general perspective on that matter that the brain is a equilibrium that's barely held together and while differences from the general population can have positives, they also dramatically increase the risk of impairment, disability and other issues.",

Your previous thought was not wrong, but you cannot divest either of your positions and be true to evidence.\n\nEven the verbiage you choose, as a comorbidity, belies a societal bias of epic proportions.

It sounds like you think they're medical model disabilities that need to be cured, but they're actually just descriptors of how people are different, in the same vein as being blonde, short, left-handed, introverted, or white. They are disabling because people with ADHD are forced to fit into boxes designed for people who are differently shaped, exactly the same as how a short person might even prefer a house that's short whereas a tall person would be literally disabled if they had to crane their neck because every house was designed for people much shorter than they are.\n\n\n\nFor example, studies have shown that when you give a communications test activity to a group of autistic people vs a group of allistic people versus a mixed group of both, only the mixed group performs worse. The autistic people are able to communicate absolutely fine with each other. The problem and hence the disability is that the allistic world refuses to cooperate with autistic people who are trying to to find ways to collaborate within mixed group.\n\n\nSo yes, the blindness comparison is an apt one. If you can accommodate it with a very simple tool with no side effects, then your disability is essentially gone as you have regained access to everything you wanted to be able to access. Of course it would still come back once you lost that tool.",

Teachers rapidly learned that me doodling on a drawing didn't mean I wasn't paying a lot of attention, especially as I asked a lot of \"insightful\" questions and they literally could see me constantly getting super interested in what they said (i was really bad at relating to my peers because of ADHD/Autism/cPTSD until maybe 3rd or 4th class, so I was way more interested in adults' company). ADHD wasn't an available diagnosis in my country until the late 1990s (which also affected my 5 years older partner) either. More importantly schools in my country didn't have insane class structures at the time, we got at the very least a ten minute break every hour and going to a different room only took a minute at the most.

They both have a place, but the medical model has been the main focus - the idea that you have an infliction and must be cured to fit society, instead of society and social convention being the thing that disables people. Generally we find something in the middle, where we look at \"improving\" the disability (ex, medication, assistance tools) to reduce distress and increase independence given that we can't make large scale changes to how the world works at a snap of our fingers, but also recognize that you can function in the right environment and it's often social convention and supports that are limiting you. You have an environment that works for you, and for some people that means you are no longer considered disabled at all, which is awesome. \n\nFor other people in jobs that could provide this but don't by default (due to social convention, etc), or in life situations that can't fit their needs, or with ADHD that can't work with mandatory life requirements, they would have to request accommodations and potentially seek medications to reduce distress, because otherwise they would be at a significant disadvantage and in increased distress compared to their peers without ADHD. And the stress and distress of being in an environment where you're not accommodated and doesn't work for you is massive and taxing.",

That's why I said that when you get an environment that works for you, you might not be disabled for a condition that others can consider very disabling. In the social model of disability, it's the environment that's disabling, not you. ADHD is really just a \"phenotype of brain\". \n\nAnd from that, I just want to point out that if you were in a different job that didn't have the same structure, it might be a very different story. Your boss could say \"sorry, long term deadlines are part of the job.\" You'd be very surprised at the amount of people who would take your job difficulties as \"laziness\" or \"poor work ethic\" (personal failings) instead of just \"my brain doesn't work this way\". And for others their ADHD affects their capacity to do things like grocery shopping, or laundry, and they don't necessarily have a partner to offset that. \n\nDisability also isn't a zero sum game - it isn't \"don't take it unless you really need it.\" The more people who come forward, the more accommodating society will become. Everyone deserves accommodations where possible so they can live and work to the best of their ability. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying you are disabled and you need to accept it. I'm just saying you could be disabled (aka put at an arbitrary and unfair disadvantage) if you found yourself in an environment that was too rigid and unsuitable and was unwilling to accommodate or adapt to how you work.",

It could be that the structure you set up doesn't work for you at some point in the future, and then you need to get an actual diagnosis. COVID had a lot of people needing meds and diagnosis where before they were doing ok, because it broke the routines and coping mechanisms people had in place. \n\nThe conflict between psychiatry's deficit model and a general neurotype is pretty obvious here - it's reasonable to acknowledge that you're one of us but also that you're not experiencing deficits that require the actual label.

The fact that you fit all the tell tale signs shows you haven't grown out of it. What you've got are good coping strategies that fit your strengths and weaknesses. Your ADHD is being successfully managed. Which is great.\n\nI will say this though. ADHD is a disorder of executive dysfunction. It impacts so many parts of your life in subtle ways that can be hard to articulate or difficult to realise until treated. This can be especially important in relationships where you rely on your partner to compensate for your ADHD weaknesses, and can result in a lot of mental load and emotional labour for them. I know a person who delayed a long time seeking treatment for their executive dysfunction, and their lives were pretty good, but their partners were worse for it.\n\n>if things like bill paying are left to me we will both lose our house\n\nI'm aware you're exaggerating, but this is not a personality trait or a mild difference in personal abilities. There are so many people who overpathologise their behaviour and need a diagnosis for everything, but be careful you're not overly doing the exact opposite.",

Among children with current ADHD, ADHD severity, presence of current co-occurring disorders, and receipt of medication and behavioral treatment were estimated. Weighted estimates were calculated overall and for demographic and clinical subgroups (n\u2009=\u200945,169).\n\n>Results\n\n>Approximately 1 in 9\u2009U.S. children have ever received an ADHD diagnosis (11.4%, 7.1 million children) and 10.5% (6.5 million) had current ADHD. Among children with current ADHD, 58.1% had moderate or severe ADHD, 77.9% had at least one co-occurring disorder, approximately half of children with current ADHD (53.6%) received ADHD medication, and 44.4% had received behavioral treatment for ADHD in the past year; nearly one third (30.1%) did not receive any ADHD-specific treatment.\n\n>Conclusions\n\n>Pediatric ADHD remains an ongoing and expanding public health concern, as approximately 1 million more children had ever received an ADHD diagnosis in 2022 than in 2016. Estimates from the 2022 NSCH provide information on pediatric ADHD during the last full year of the COVID-19 pandemic and can be used by policymakers, government agencies, health care systems, public health practitioners, and other partners to plan for needs of children with ADHD.",

As Baughman (2006) argues: \u2018Virtually all the symptoms of ADHD relate to classroom behaviour. Children who don\u2019t do homework, fidget, squirm, interrupt, and are forgetful and disorganized are assumed to have a biochemical imbalance in their brain. These children can be difficult to control in a classroom and in many cases are more compliant when drugged. However, there is absolutely no scientifically valid evidence that compliant \u2013drugged students learn faster.\u2019 (2006, p. xiii) He goes on to conclude: \u2018ADHD is a disorder manufactured to match our times. It is a quick catch-all diagnosis with a magic bullet treatment\u2019 (2006, p. xiii). Other critics view ADHD as a social construct which is the result of our performance-driven cultures and societies, citing the prolific increase of Ritalin and other stimulants to \u2018treat\u2019 ADHD as nothing more than a method of performance enhancement.",

This is a simplification, but I think the conditions of childhood have just changed and that has exposed some of these issues, at least in my family.\u00a0\n\n\nMy parents grew up in the 60s-70s and described their childhood as never boring: they spent all their time outside, riding bikes, running around in the woods, reading magazines in the library, eating cheap ice cream etc. They were good students, but they didn't feel a need to go to college because they had good opportunities available that didn't require it, so they didn't have to focus too much on studying or homework. My parents have struggled with depression, but it hit them as adults when they were struggling to cope with some family issues, never as kids.\n\n\nFast forward 50/60 years to my nieces and nephews growing up in the 2010-2020s, and those roads are way less safe to ride bikes on, the woods they played in are now a strip mall, the new ice cream shop charges $8 a scoop, the local library is only open during school hours because it was de-funded. The family businesses my parents started out in (sewing factory for my mom, machining for my dad) went out of business in the 90s. My nieces and nephews pour themselves over school work to get into college, but they aren't even convinced that it will be worth it. There's just not much opportunity in our town and everyone thinks they have to leave. They, and their friends, are super depressed, some have OCD, several have ADHD.\u00a0\n\n\nI definitely don't think everything was perfect or even much better in the past, but in many ways the expectations of childhood and adolesence were different, and the conditions for children today make these problems more noticeable, and the depression and anxiety epidemic just magnifies all of it even more.",

I\u2018m a biologist and also diagnosed with ADHD and depression and here to say: it can be both.\n\nDepressive patterns, especially seasonal, might have helped our ancestors conserve energy during winter by forcing them to slow down when there wasn\u2018t much food. Anxious patterns might have led to them focusing on an issue until it was solved, rather than them forgetting about it. In my other comment in this thread I also linked a study suggesting an evolutionary advantage to ADHD patterns in nomadic communities.\n\nBut evolutionary advantages are not a model we can apply to modern humanity. They might explain why something heritable kept being passed on and is so prevalent nowadays, but as contexts change, a trait\u2018s net outcome changes.\n\nTo bring it back to that famous Darwin quote: \u201esurvival of the fittest\u201c - fit not in physical fitness but who fits the environment best, who is the most adapted, at this precise moment, in this precise place.\n\nTraits might have been evolutionary advantages for millennia and can still be debilitating now.
