Still small in absolute terms and not too surprising given its an actual weight loss drug that seems to work.",

Cutting weight sucks for everyone.\n\nIf you find you need to actually fight for this, you have a problem. You might pretend you don't but you do. The severity of it is what matters, and that's where the drugs like ozempic come in. Just like everyone can get distracted but only for some people it's a serious life-impacting issue.\n\nCICO is an option, but you'll find yourself having to do this entire life, constantly fighting against your body. Just like ozempic, it's not a one-and-done deal. The main problem is that CICO implies you'll keep doing it (just like taking ozempic), and that's fine until something happens when you can't - any major illness will do and it'll be a game over for you. Another problem is that CICO measures I, and there is a lot of assumptions about O, but the O is something that varies heavily from person-to-person - all those 2000 calories a day things are merely a suggestion, not an actual thing (I know for fact that 2000 calories per day will put me in overweight category very quickly). So you have to derive your O based on your diet and weight results.\n\nIt might sound like \"well, just eat less\" is a simple idea, but the amount of effort required also varies from person to person, and how much difference is there between and what they actually need, and where their hormone levels actually are and what that means in terms of a person's typical intake. You can change your diet only so much, and for many people that's not enough. And that's what I mean when I say that \"we're not a bag for lettuce\" so you're wrong that this is a strawman.\n\nFrom what you wrote, you have an extremely narrow experience and point of view on the whole problem. I'm not going to try to convince you about this because until you experience more about this, this sort of discussion tends to lead nowhere.",

At least one in eight women will develop thyroid issues over their lifetime, and research is currently putting towards that number being much larger but undiagnosed and untreated.\n\nAnd this idea that somehow mindful diet and small adjustments can counteract 20 to 25% difference is absurd. That means people being miserable or hungry a lot of the time. I work in mental health and I used to work on an obesity related project, that's the sort of difference that makes a huge quality of life issue. People with hypothyroidism also don't really have the energy to spare for additional activity.",

PCOS does not affect BMR and studies show that women with PCOS can lose the same amount of weight as women without PCOS if they receive the same support (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26508882/).

You are literally forced to change your habits because you do not want to eat. People intend to take these drugs for 6 months to a year, which will absolutely change how you interact with food.  Also, your doctor should be discussing how to maintain your muscle mass during this weight loss, which includes protein intake and at least some exercise. \nSource: I am on this medication.",

Saying there is an obesity epidemic is like saying there is a \u201csneezing epidemic\u201d every year instead of \u201ccold season\u201d. It\u2019s a nice euphemism that takes the attention of the root problem - choices people make (excluding of course those suffering from medical conditions that result in obesity.)\n\nThese drugs treat the symptom, at an astronomical cost, with hitherto unknown long term effects. I promise better diet and exercise are cheaper, and don\u2019t have crazy ass [side effects](https://www.wegovy.com/dashboard/my-library/week-02-tips-for-managing-common-side-effects.html#:~:text=Common%20side%20effects%20of%20Wegovy,runny%20nose%20or%20sore%20throat). Plus you\u2019ll look and, more importantly, *feel* better than any drug can make you look and feel.\n\nSadly, I\u2019m certain this hard truth will be upsetting to a lot of people.

Trying to get obese while exercising every day is another rare and tough task, those edge cases are obviously not the aim of post\n\nlike, we can see the creep of obesity spreading to cultures adopting our modern diet of ultra-processed, factory produced food and goods, \n\nmaybe my post had nothing to do with you specifically or other individuals with individual health needs but instead was addressing the massive societal issue highlighted by the article we are all talking about?",

You have ozempic users claiming the drug makes them go back to a \"normal\" amount of food noise. But honestly as somebody who's constantly hungry and only staying fit due to pure willpower I don't think these drugs give you a normal food noise. I track my kcal intake daily, and do sports 6 days a week. You couldn't tell looking at me, but it's a daily struggle and has been ever since turning an adult 15 years ago. I imagine most people are similar to me, and either stay on top of it or get fat.\n\nThese drugs just take away any food noise you have, and unless you're in the \"genetically blessed\" category of people that forget to eat sometimes, everybody has food noise.",

I started dieting again last August, started Contrave about 2 months ago, and started Wegovy 2.5 weeks ago.  The difference that Contrave and Wegovy make is night and day.  \nWhile I was just dieting it was a constant struggle to not pick up a snack, or eat just a little more.  I was always hungry.  Once I started the Contrave, I started to actually feel full after eating a meal, even a small one (by my standards).  I could eat the recommended portion size, and then just be done, not wanting more.  I'd stay satiated for a few hours, but was usually hungry by the next meal time.  \nThe Wegovy is like the Contrave, but more?  I don't feel hungry often, and while before I struggled to stay under my daily kcals, now I'm 4-500 kcals under and go to bed not feeling hungry in the slightest.  \n\nI honestly have no idea if this is the \"normal\" amount of food noise or not, since I'm not sure if I've ever had the normal amount.  But it is the first time I've understood people who can just eat 1-2 slices of pizza and put the rest away, rather than eat 75% of it, and put the rest away while still feeling hungry.",

Any food, all foods\u2014veggies, cookies, didn\u2019t care, just always wanted to EAT. \u00a0\n\nWLS curbed my constant hunger, but Vyvanse/Mounjaro killed it.\u00a0I literally only think of food now when I\u2019m actually hungry. It\u2019s truly a revelation.\n\nI didn\u2019t start taking ADHD meds regularly until early last year despite being\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0\u2248 15 years ago (*definitely* had ADHD all my life, though). I\u00a0was put on Mounjaro around that same time as my 80lb weight loss with WLS had almost no effect on my A1C. I was still right on the cusp of diabetes.\n\nBy that time, my weight loss from surgery had been stable two years. After starting these meds I dropped a further 50lbs with no effort.\n\nI am now convinced my lifelong, constant hunger and struggle with my weight was down to a combo of ADHD-fueled dopamine seeking hunger, and hereditary insulin dysfunction. I have a very long, *very* ugly history of Type 2 diabetes on one side of my family. My parent on that side and 4 of their 8 siblings are diagnosed. Both sides of my family are originally from rural West Africa\u2014eating too much and moving too little isn\u2019t really an option over there, so the long history of blood sugar issues on that side is definitely genetic.\n\nI do not regret weight loss surgery, but if I\u2019d started these meds prior to having surgery, I wouldn't have had it at all.",

There are some exceptions where convienent food is relatively healthy and flavorful, but it tends to be difficult to find and/or expensive.\n\nI can see how people who are upset with the \"very few convienent healthy food options available\" problem seeing the solution be \"take drugs to stave off the worst parts of this unhealthy food.\" The alternative solution of regulating/taxing unhealthy food isn't being seriously considered, which is frustrating. Like another comment said, it's like seeing a bunch of people get poisoned, lose function of their legs, and seeing wheelchair usage spike. It's better than not treating them at all, but why can't we focus on stopping the poison? Instead, we have \"here's a wheelchair\" or \"hey poor people, keep an eye out for the poison, will ya?\"\n\nAs someone who travels a lot for work, it truly is difficult to get healthy food for lunch while I'm working; if it weren't for the fact that I burn a ton of calories during my work, I would probably be at an unhealthy weight by now. Every once in a while, I'll stumble upon a fast food Mediterranean place or whatever, but most of the time my options are \"skip lunch\" or \"eat crappy food\"",

A lot of the perception is because a lot of folks on both sides of things do a lot of virtue signaling.

They aren't exercising more, just putting an extremely low amount of food in their body.\n\nFor morbidly obese people (like 100+ lbs overweight) that have no shot of change, I understand. But there's people that are like 50 lbs overweight using this drug to starve themselves until they are underweight. This leads to your body not only consuming fat for nutrients, but eventually muscles too. Then once you get off of it, all of those habits will come back because because health was never prioritized.\n\nThere also seems to be permanent effects to your metabolism when you use starvation methods to lose weight. Your metabolic rate will lower itself since your body will go into \"starvation mode\" to preserve as much energy as possible. There was a study in the Biggest Loser contestants where their resting metabolic rate went down like 700 calories when they were crash dieting. Many of them gained an average of 90lbs back, but their RMR remained at the low level permanently. This means they needed to maintain an even lower amount of calories to lose the weight again. This doesn't happen when you gradually lose weight with proper diet and exercise.",

A few more quotes:\n\n> It is not because you were born into unhappy circumstances or ended up in an unhappy situation. It's that you judged being unhappy to be good for you.\n\n> People are constantly selecting their lifestyles. But why are we still unable to change? It is because you are making the persistent decision not to change your lifestyle.\n\n> If I change, the world will change. No one else will change the world for me.\n\n> What you are lacking is the courage to be happy.\n\nI grew up fat. I read the book, studied the basics of strength training, went to the gym, and outlined standards regarding what foods my body *deserves*. I am no longer fat.\n\nIt was my personal responsibility to take care of my body. It wasn't anyone else's responsibility, nor was it anyone else's fault. We live in a time and society where people are free to make their own choices regarding what to eat, but freedom comes with consequences. You can't have your cake and eat it too.\n\nYou don't agree, and that's okay. People who choose to be unhappy will have a thousand reasons to be so; people who choose to be happy will have ten thousand more. Glass half empty vs glass half full kinda thing. We only have one life to live; giving up personal agency to embrace reasons to be unhappy seems less than optimal. My sincere wish is for you to be happy, even if we disagree on topics, because at the end of the day, we are but strangers living life in our unique ways.",

We know about healthy food options, and staying active and having healthy habits, and so far have been able to keep our kids out of the traps we fell into as kids.  We never force them to finish their plates, and i know overall they are eating much less than i did at their age.  They seem safely on track to a healthy lifestyle.\n\nBut my wife and i have always struggled.  She took the GLP-1 at the suggestion of her doctor.  I was skeptical, but the way it has turned her life around has been honestly miraculous.  She has always had inflammation/pain issues on top of her weight, and despite everything she tried, never could lose more than 5-10 lbs.  She has also had very irregular, painful periods all her life (she got put on birth control to fix this, first... which of course leads to a slew of side effects, like further weight gain).  Within a week of starting the medication, her pain from inflammation disappeared. Her menstrual issues also fixed themselves.  Then came the weight loss.  Overall, she has lost almost 100 lbs, and has stepped back how much of the medication she uses, as she is at a weight she is very happy with.  She can't stop completely though, because if she stops for even a few weeks, the pain flares back up, drastically reducing quality of life. The pain and inflammation is not directly due to the weight, clearly, but no one has ever figured out why.\n\nWe DO NOT want this medication for our children.  Again, I have always been skeptical about weight loss drugs, but with the impact this drug has had on my wife, I've come to the conclusion that the food most widely available to us (society) is causing more issues than simply \"now you are fat\".  It's impacting hormones and who knows what else that is manipulating the balance of what is healthy or normal in our bodies.  Very complicated issues that are very hard to unravel.  Hell, why else, within the last century, have we gotten to a point where even the most poor are overweight and obese?\n\nSo we choose the better food and habits for our family to keep them at a good place now, to not develop these issues, hopefully.  But the meds can help us that are too far gone due to choices that weren't ours.",

You also claimed that obesity causes various conditions, which is simply not true. It is *correlated* with them in the US, though not cross-culturally, which suggests the true relationship is much more complicated than the simplistic story you're telling here.\n\nThe absurdly disproportionate focus on weight in the US medical system has been shown to lead to adverse health outcomes (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4132299/) due to both misattribution of health problems to weight and more direct weight bias. The latter, in particular, is considered in the widely-used biopsychosocial model of eating disorders to be one of the main causes of anorexia, the most deadly mental illness in existence.\n\nIt's also very American to phrase this in terms of money. \"Loss of productivity\" and healthcare costs are a fucked up reason to care about people's health. Why don't we prioritize people's health because they're human beings and we want them to live good lives?",

Some women naturally hold an A cup and can get up to a B or C if overweight.\n\nMost female celebrities we see have low body fat percentage (22%) which is a fitness level. Women are normally at around 25-30% for a healthy level. If you make Kiera Knightley gain a bunch of weight it would not go automatically to her chest. She doesn\u2019t have that kind of body type.

The idea that it takes a tonne of calories to maintain muscle is an old myth and modern science says it's something really small like 6-10 calories per pound of muscle per day.\n\n\nThe vast majority of people trying to lose weight are not going to be putting on any serious amount of muscle that eats up a lot of calories. Putting on 20lbs of muscle would be incredibly impressive for a physically unhealthy person, and that would only be around 160-200 calories per day of maintenance, less than a Starbucks latte.\n\n\nAnd anecdotally, most people who exercise end up eating snacks after because they've earned it and are hungry, and overestimate how many calories their run burned.",

It\u2019s easiest to get this from food (carbs, mostly), then fat stores, and then muscle. However, it\u2019s not really a process that happens \u2018one at a time\u2019. It\u2019s just that breaking down food is so fast that there\u2019s a negligible effect on body mass if sufficient calories are provided.\n\nWhen in a calorie deficit, the body breaks down fat stores but that\u2019s a much less efficient process, meaning there\u2019s more time for the body to also break down muscle. Typically, you see 15-20% lean mass loss (of weight lost) during a calorie deficit. If muscle was truly the easiest source of glucose, the numbers would be switched.\n\nHigh protein intake and resistance training will absolutely help mitigate lean mass loss, though. They don\u2019t generally stop the above process, they just combat it by providing the necessary tools for building muscle. In someone totally new to resistance training, this may even be enough to see an increase in muscle mass despite being in a deficit (but there are some variables affecting that).\n\n*Edit: added the last paragraph & clarification*",

If we take the general population risk of 1.2% then the general population risk taking ozempic would be somewhere around 1.8%.\n\nEven if it's true that ozempic increases the risk of Thryoid cancer it still almost certainly outweighs the risk of being Obese.

This was absolutely not just a case *human's weren't omniscient*. The drug company knew for a long time, and governments knew too, but it was big business, and through threat to anyone who'd speak up and insane laws to protect corporations, they kept it out knowingly doing harm for a long time, it was NOT pulled as you say. There were journalists wanting to warn the public for years, but laws were such that they'd be sued/jailed regardless of the tragic and widespread health issues occurring, and being absolutely right.",

Obese people by definition *can* survive without eating for days on end. In fact that's the most healthy thing they can do when they are obese. It even saves them money, time and effort to do so.",

They can't have just one drink. If a trigger happens, they'll reach for the bottle. It's not something that can be effectively controlled by their higher executive functions in the moment. That's why so much treatment for this involves preventing the situations from happening in the first place. Don't keep alcohol around. Don't go to bars or parties where alcohol will be flowing freely. It's about applying that executive function *before* the trigger event happens.\n\nNow imagine your substance isn't alcohol, but food. Something you MUST consume and MUST be around. In fact, your body has complex mechanisms to demand you consume it. You can't just swear it off. You are constantly exposed to the substance you're addicted to.\n\nI've been able to reduce some of this effect by cutting out/down on processed foods and eating food that's closer to its natural form, but it still doesn't fix the problem entirely. I try not to bring junk food into the house or eat at restaurants with absurd portion sizes. That all helps, but it doesn't get rid of it. If these medications can help people like me deal with this and achieve a healthier weight, they are absolutely worth it, and we shouldn't be shaming people for doing what they need to do.\n\nI'm genuinely happy for you and others who are able to mediate this on your own, but that's not a universal experience. The body and brain are complicated and some people are just broken in some way we don't yet fully understand. I suspect that growing up eating largely synthetic food does something to us, but there isn't much evidence one way or the other.",

If you grow up on that, like many do, it's entirely possible that it screws something up in the brain or body, potentially permanently. We just don't know for sure.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between processed food consumption and obesity, but there are many other factors such as car dependency, sedentary work and lifestyles, etc. We've built a world that is largely incompatible with human physiology, especially in the US and the areas we've influenced heavily. Fixing those issues would be far better, but that is a massive societal lift that is not going to happen any time soon. In the meantime, people are dying unnecessarily.",

We all know the food we eat today is full of stuff in it that is very dangerous on the long run!\n\nLike smoking a cigaret! 1 a day and your body can expell the bad substances in your body. smoke 5 a day and your body is NOT fast enough for it and it will accumulate in your body more and more!\n\nLook at ASPARTAME, AMINOSTEET, E954, E955, E961 and so many others.\n\nIt's in parcticly all products we eat!\n\nAnd CODEX ALIMENTARIUS discusses the AMOUNT needed to become unhealthy or toxic! THE AMOUNT NEEDED.\n\nBut on your energydrink is only so much in it, and determent safe to use, But what happens when you drink 5 of them, Or even have an entire DIET based on NON sugar but it all tastes sweet anyway? No sheet in the world that tells us how much i can use of this and that a day, kinda like counting the calories.\n\nSo we stuff us full with bad food, and then have medication to maintain it! So you learn to live with it, instead of really dealing with the problem! The core of it all! FOOD itself!\n\nEver wondered why they use these CODE words for these things, like E954?\n\nWell when you get conscious once in a month and read the label for the stuff that is in it, you read all kinds of things and then this code, your brain will move on and even ignore it. If it said ASPARTAME a lot would get awakend more, even people trying to avoid aspartame r lured in this way if they don;t know the code words for it. your brain will move on thinking it;s all okay.\n\nA lot of people still mistake the words, TASTES LIKE , or flavoured with!!!! SO when you buy pudding vanilla and your cover says TASTES like, you can be damm sure that there is not even the slightest vanilla in it but artificial taste!\n\nYou will GET CANCER 100% sure if u use aspartame daily! it's like russian roulette you play with your life, there will come a time that the bullet is in the right chamber. But we will not see our food as the cause of it all , because it went so slow! and we look in places where we did things in short while. So we rather blame pollution to the air or our work we did, then the food we eat daily! Control the food and you control it all. Population control use to be cigarets!!! or tabacco! now it's ASPARTAME people and it reaches our smallest kids and good thinking people that TRUST the things they eat r not bad for them!\\~:(",
