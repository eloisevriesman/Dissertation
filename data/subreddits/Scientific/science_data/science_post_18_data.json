I am still working my way through all of it so I may need to retract this, but it seems like it really only accounts for diet and it seems like there is some level of correlation between people who eat poorly and the way they look after themselves in other ways (exercise, sleep, air quality, mental health, mental fitness/challenge, all sorts of things) and the reverse, people who look after themselves generally also eat better. That often isn\u2019t explored, and what impact that has on the results.",

If it is the case - as it may well be - that one of the reasons why UPFs are bad for your health is because they are - on average - low in fibre, then we should be demonising low fibre foods as a class rather than a type of food which in many cases happens to be low in fibre. That's like saying blue foods are bad because many blue foods have food coloring additives. You end up persuading people not to eat UPFs which happen to be high in fibre.

            "body": ">**Background and Objectives**\n\n>Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are linked to cardiometabolic diseases and neurologic outcomes, such as cognitive decline and stroke. However, it is unclear whether food processing confers neurologic risk independent of dietary pattern information. We aimed to (1) investigate associations between UPFs and incident cognitive impairment and stroke and (2) compare these associations with other commonly recommended dietary patterns in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study. This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled Black and White adults in the United States from 2003 to 2007.\n\n>**Methods**\n\n>The NOVA system was used to categorize items from a baseline food frequency questionnaire according to the level of processing. Participants with incomplete or implausible self-reported dietary data were excluded. Consumption for each category (grams) was normalized to total grams consumed. Scores quantifying adherence to a Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet were also calculated. Incident cognitive impairment was defined using performance relative to a normative sample on memory and fluency assessments. Incident stroke was identified through adjudicated review of medical records.\n\n>**Results**\n\n>The cognitive impairment cohort (n = 14,175) included participants without evidence of impairment at baseline who underwent follow-up testing. The stroke cohort (n = 20,243) included participants without a history of stroke. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, a 10% increase in relative intake of UPFs was associated with higher risk of cognitive impairment (hazard ratio \\[HR\\] = 1.16, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.24,\u00a0p\u00a0= 1.01 \u00d7 10\u22125) and intake of unprocessed or minimally processed foods with lower risk of cognitive impairment (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83\u20130.94,\u00a0p\u00a0= 1.83 \u00d7 10\u22124). Greater intake of UPFs (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.14,\u00a0p\u00a0= 1.12 \u00d7 10\u22122) and unprocessed or minimally processed foods (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.86\u20130.95,\u00a0p\u00a0= 2.13 \u00d7 10\u22124) were also associated with risk of stroke in multivariable Cox models. The effect of UPFs on stroke risk was greater among Black than White participants (UPF-by-race interaction HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.29,\u00a0p\u00a0= 1.50 \u00d7 10\u22122). Associations between UPFs and both cognitive impairment and stroke were independent of adherence to the Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets.\n\n>**Discussion**\n\n>Food processing may be important to brain health in older adults independent of known risk factors and adherence to recommended dietary patterns.",
