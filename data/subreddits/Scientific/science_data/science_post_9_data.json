The team evaluated a new drug for enhancing the brain\u2019s resilience to changes driven by Alzheimer\u2019s, showing promising results for patients with mild to moderate forms of the disease in its first human trial.\n>\n>The drug LM11A-31, developed by Stanford professor Dr. Frank Longo and UCSF professor Dr. Stephen Massa, targets the P75 neurotrophin receptor (P75NTR), located on cells in the brain. P75NTR helps regulate various processes like cell survival, growth and death \u2013 like a traffic controller, deciding which signals get through and which don\u2019t. The drug enhances the passage of signals which promote cell survival and growth\n\nPaper: [p75 neurotrophin receptor modulation in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2a trial | Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02977-w)",
