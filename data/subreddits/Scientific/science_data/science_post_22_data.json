You might lose voters strongly apposed to stance B but you would gain probably a similar amount strongly support of stance B.\n\nLeaving out such critical details would render this study near meaningless. Even just who the individual is and the party they represent would change everything aswell as what the change is.

Conducted in Flanders, the research finds that politicians who frequently change their policy stances are viewed less favorably by the public, regardless of gender.\n\nThe motivation behind this study stems from the dual expectations placed on political parties. On one hand, parties are expected to maintain clear, stable policy positions, which fosters trust and ideological clarity. On the other hand, parties need to be responsive and adaptable to changing public opinions and circumstances.\n\nThe study revealed that candidates who frequently changed their policy positions were evaluated less positively than those who did so infrequently. This negative perception extended to trustworthiness and voting intentions. Candidates who frequently repositioned were viewed as less honest, decisive, and competent.",
