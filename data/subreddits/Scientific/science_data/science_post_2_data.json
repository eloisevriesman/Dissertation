            "body": "**TLDR:** Some preliminary tests using old ground up concrete (the hard stuff like sidewalks are made from) as \"flux\" material in a steel furnace melt worked just fine, and all the heat and whatnot caused the cured-cement to chemically react back to new-cement so that the left over \"slag\" is essentially freshly-made \"cement\" (the powder stuff sold in bags that gets mixed with water/sand/etc. to make concrete).  Next steps are to characterize the strengths and/or weaknesses of the steels and cements made from the process compared to what's made using standard non-recycled methods.",

There's no need to make molten calcium oxide or melt the aggregates.",

These ingredients, when heated at high temperatures form a rock-like substance that is ground into the fine powder that we commonly think of as cement.\"  -- *Portland Cement Association*.\n\nSo it is not pure limestone, but rather a mix of ingredients.  Cement kilns run at 1300-1450C.\n\nVery high temperatures applied to a variety of mineral sources can make them \"cementitious\" (harden when water is added).  Lime happens to be an old one, as was volcanic ash used by the Romans.  Blast furnace slag and coal ash (the rocky bits in coal that don't burn) are often used a substitutes for some of the portland cement in a mix.  Brick dust can also be used sometimes, as the bricks were run through a furnace.  Some pottery shards could be used, but they are not usually available in enough quantity.",
