So concludes a new Utrecht University article published in Nature Climate Change on 23 May 2024, which used a state-of-the-art global water quantity and quality model to estimate clean water scarcity until the end of the century.\n\nHumans require clean water for drinking and sanitation purposes, but also for the production of food, energy and manufactured goods. As communities and policymakers grapple with water scarcity issues on the ground, researchers at Utrecht University aim to shed light on the escalating global clean water crisis.\n\nCurrent and future water scarcity\nUsing simulations from a state-of-the-art water quantity and quality model, the authors assess present-day and future global water scarcity. \"Climate change and socioeconomic developments have multi-faceted impacts on the availability and quality of, and demands for, water resources in the future,\" says lead author Dr. Edward Jones. \"Changes in these three aspects are crucial for evaluating future water scarcity.\"\n\nThe study estimates that 55% of the global population currently lives in areas that experience a lack of clean water in at least one month per year. \"By the end of the century, this may be as high as 66%,\" remarks Jones.\n\n  \n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02007-0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02007-0)",
