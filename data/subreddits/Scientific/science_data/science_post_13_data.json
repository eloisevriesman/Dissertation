Many of the methods of propaganda don't involve direct falsehoods: Uncle Sam pointing directly out of the frame of a poster at the person viewing the poster with the caption \"Buy War Bonds\" contains no objectively false information, but would be considered propaganda nonetheless.\n\n\"Disinformation\" is indeed a term that was popularized recently (though your characterization of it as merely a way to discredit information is laughably false) but if used for the benefit of a nation-state, it falls within a subset of well-worn propaganda techniques.",
