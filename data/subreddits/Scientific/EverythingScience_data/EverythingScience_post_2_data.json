It uses the word \"marijuana\" which is an imprecise slang term, usually referring to dried cannabis flowers. Does this mean the study excludes cannabis oil, edibles and other cannabis products?   \n\n2. When measuring the rate of increase of cannabis use (figure 1) they use per capita numbers. But when comparing the  alcohol use and cannabis use (figure 2) they use absolute numbers. Absolute numbers do not correct for population growth and make it difficult to tell if alcohol consumption has gone up, remained stable, or gone down.  \n\nThings like these are red flags, making me wonder what the researchers are trying to obfuscate and why.",
