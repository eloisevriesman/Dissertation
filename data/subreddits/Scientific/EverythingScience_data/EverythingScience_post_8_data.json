The cicadas of Myanmar emerge every 13 years, while the Brazilian cicadas emerge every 17. Next year they will hatch, simultaneously, for the first time in 221 years. Crops from both countries will be decimated. Unlike Myanmar and Brazil, Indonesia has no cicada population. I was surprised to see Indonesian sesame seed futures priced so low. I made a purchase. And now, if the shortage spikes the global price even ten percent. We'll profit.  \n\n\u2026\u2026\n\nNow would anyone like some BK?",

To most humans, they\u2019re an ephemeral spectacle and an ear-splitting nuisance, and then they\u2019re gone. To many other animals, plants, and microbes, they\u2019re a rare feast, bringing new life to forests long past their death.\n\nRead the full story: [https://www.wired.com/story/periodical-cicada-emergence-illinois/](https://www.wired.com/story/periodical-cicada-emergence-illinois/)",
