            "body": "I worked in jewelry and I can tell you this:  the quality of natural stones (diamonds) on the market every year decreases as the price increases. The availability of better quality diamonds is there, but for exorbitant prices. The increase in price and increase in rarity is all artificial. One company, DeBeers has had a monopoly on the diamond market forever and they set all that shit. \n\nI hope artificial diamonds catch on and small companies come in loading the diamond market with high quality rocks that shake up the industry and knock all these large companies that have monopolies on their asses.  Let it be one more industry that us millennials kill.",

We might be capable of some rational thinking, but humans inherently are programmed to be driven by reactionary gut instinct, and to go against that instinct requires consistent effort.\n\nMarketing psychology knows this all too well. They don't care about appealing to reason, they focus their efforts on tricking that gut instinct, because that part is so easily manipulated.\n\nAt the end of the day, no matter how smart each of us might be, deep down we are *all* stupid, the question is moreso whether each of us will put in the effort to suppress the stupid each day.",

When people go sell these diamonds they find out they\u2019re not worth shit and some people won\u2019t even buy them. The place I used to work at would put 4 shitty quarter karat diamonds in a setting next to each other, call it 1 karat and sell it with a 100% markup.

Researchers have figured that a gallium-nickel-iron mixture \u2014 coupled with a pinch of silicon \u2014 is optimal for catalyzing the growth of diamonds.\n2. with this blend, the team obtained diamonds from the crucible's base after just 15 minutes. Within two and a half hours, a more complete diamond film formed\n3. Spectroscopic analyses showed that this film was largely pure but contained a few silicon atoms\n4. One problem is that the diamonds grown with this technique are tiny; the largest ones are hundreds of thousands of times smaller than the ones grown with HPHT.  That makes them too small to be used as jewels.\n5. In about a year or two, the world might have a clearer picture of things like possible commercial impact",

These also apply to synthetics, which are identical besides trace elements that don\u2019t really matter at roughly 1/3rd the price. \n\n1: It\u2019s a 10 on the mohs hardness scale, literally the HARDEST substance on earth. The gap between 9 and 10 on the scale is a lot bigger than the gap between 1 and 9. There is something pretty cool about having the worlds hardest substance on your finger. \n\n2: Because it is so hard, it has the SHARPEST facets. To the extent that experienced gemmologists can ID a diamond just from looking at facet edges. There\u2019s basically no rounding, so it reflects light better and looks crisper. There are certainly similar stones that are close enough that you won\u2019t notice without a microscope, but still, a SLIGHT advantage over other stones. \n\n3: Because diamond is resistant to heat, you can literally cast in gold AROUND it. You can do this with corundum too (Sapphire and Ruby), but there is a visible difference between \u201cwhite\u201d sapphire and diamond, so if you\u2019re wanting a clear stone, diamond is your only real option for a really sparkly \u201cwhite\u201d stone. Very niche technique, but if for some reason it\u2019s a requirement for your design, diamond is the best option. \n\nBeen out of school for 8 years, so I\u2019ll come back and edit in more if I think of any. Gemmology doesn\u2019t exactly come up frequently. :)",

Researchers have figured that a gallium-nickel-iron mixture \u2014 coupled with a pinch of silicon \u2014 is optimal for catalyzing the growth of diamonds.\n2. with this blend, the team obtained diamonds from the crucible's base after just 15 minutes. Within two and a half hours, a more complete diamond film formed\n3. Spectroscopic analyses showed that this film was largely pure but contained a few silicon atoms\n4. One problem is that the diamonds grown with this technique are tiny; the largest ones are hundreds of thousands of times smaller than the ones grown with HPHT. That makes them too small to be used as jewels.\n5. In about a year or two, the world might have a clearer picture of things like possible commercial impact",
