For instance the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression was first observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The initial discovery occurred somewhat serendipitously when patients being treated for IBD with SSRIs reported significant improvements in their depressive symptoms. This gave rise to oversimplistic and  now thoroughly scientifically debunked 'chemical imbalance' theory  that is still used as the major marketing slogan by pharmaceutical companies.",
