This article notably does not describe a scheme which can be used to transmit anything. \n\nOne might be able to physically distribute a quantum computer, which might help with the interconnect scaling problem, but that's nothing to do with the internet. It's essentially just a way to have long wires within the same black box.",

Also can create a super quantum computer by connecting a bunch of separate qcomps connected by the communication grid.",
