She had the right to withdraw the funds, but she lied about why she was doing it in order to benefit herself personally, which is fraud.\n\nTrump leveraged his real estate based on a specific valuation. The bank agreed with him and loaned him the money. Then he paid it back. No fraud. No victim. Not the same.",
