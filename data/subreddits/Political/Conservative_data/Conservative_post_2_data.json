There was no real reason for an anti-Assad protest movement in the West since we all agreed that Assad sucks and should go. The same isn't true at all in the case of Israel; the pro-Palestine protesters advocate for a very different course than the Western governments, so trying to get their will by applying political pressure makes sense from their point of view.",
