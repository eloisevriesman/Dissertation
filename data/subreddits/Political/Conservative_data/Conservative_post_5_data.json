It\u2019s why she keeps pushing her line of questioning so narrowly. I would argue that the FBI\u2019s looming investigation of the Trump campaign as a result of the Steele Dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign, was far more harmful to the transition of power and legitimacy of the presidency than anything that occurred up to and including January 6th. Biden\u2019s ability to take office and lead the executive branch was never undermined, where as Trump was setup to fail and never have the full trust or cooperation of those underlying agencies and also public perception. With a fair and reasonable analysis, it\u2019s clear that the Trump administration was unjustly hamstrung in ways no other administration had ever encountered.",

Someone who's particularly aggressive with one party's members and policies, and waves by and softballs her preferred party, is just a politically biased, devisive, talk show host. But if you don't appear before the left's popular talk show hosts, they say that you're dodging being critically challenged. They're not remotely critical in the wide scope of politics, and their only aim is to make you look horrible. So like Cruz here demonstrates, you appear on TV with them, knowing what they're after, and ready to make Them look like twits. Mission accomplished.\n\nHowever, the Democrat viewers of these twit talk show hosts were likely not phased, don't listen to what Cruz is saying, don't consider that he's even remotely making a valid point, because they've already made up their minds (rather the media made it up for them, and they... drank the kool-aid, so to speak) that Cruz, like everyone on the right, is automatically a liar with bad intentions. These shows, no matter what someone on the right says, will twist it to accommodate their own narrative, the approved narrative on the left. On the contrary, (while I'm not a big fan of Cruz, I'll give credit where deserved) Cruz showed up in good faith, argued in good faith, he's presenting truthful arguments, and this host and likely viewers remain.... unmoved. These hosts Only pander to the left. They aren't enlightening them beyond.. the one, strict, leftist viewpoint and propaganda. Even if you're on the left, they'll only allow you to contend that there was foul play if a candidate on the left loses. All wrongs are done on the right, exclusively. That's their position. It's of course ridiculous, but they'll defend it to no end. You cannot suggest there was any foul play on left however. Zero. \n\nWe don't all agree on the right, but that's a feature not a bug. We allow one another the expression of other and competing ideas. Not so on the left. And that's another thing the left have in common with Palestinians, one expression of law to rule them all. The left practice like a totally secular, hedonist version of Sharia Law. Cancel culture is their version of stoning someone to death for defying them. \n\nThe left's talking heads have one objective, make the GOP members look bad, corrupt, and evil to the core. Generate negative sound bites that go viral. They have the brains of a 12 yr old Tik-Tok wannabe 'influencer'.",

Before you get mad at me hear me out.\n\nTrump as a developer sets every debate with money.  Money is power in development and construction.  \n\nWashington and the Democratic left plays\n an entirely different game.  My only hope is he has learned something from losing this game once and will play it entirely different but I\u2019m not holding my breath because too many Republicans in power now would rather lose and complain than take the necessary steps to win - win what should be the easiest win in modern history against one of the worst (I believe second worst) president in American history.  Who by the way is part of a party that much of America agrees is farrrr to leftist for its taste",
