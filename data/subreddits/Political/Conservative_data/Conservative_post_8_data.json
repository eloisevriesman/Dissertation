Ships were destroyed, docks were destroyed, and even trees were cut down (to remove the war potential of German forests). The madness was only stopped in 1947 when the Allies realized that the economic recovery of Germany was vital to the recovery of the continent as a whole, and also the Cold War had begun so they needed Germany to be strong again.

(Correct me if wrong). Secondly, to claim \"plot by Jews\" would require more than just one dude (Morgenthau) to support the plot. Was there provable widescale support for it by Jews? Second question would be: by which Jews? \u2014 American? British? French?",

Perhaps I generalize to much, but for me if the people planning it, even more so the lead, all share a unique characteristic ,even if it's only a handful of people, I would except it as being a Russian plot. I should clarify I understand and separate participants from the general public. I wouldn't blame all of Judaism over a few.\n\n\nI'd consider them zionists, but from what I know it was only a few in the American government who were putting this together.\n\n\nI guess it can't really be viewed as controversial, considering it didn't happen like the other extreme or bizarre policies our government implemented.",

If a Kurd in the Iranian government comes up with a plan, I won't call it a \"Kurdish plan\". That wouldn't make any sense because that assumes ethnic characteristics are playing some great role, as opposed to being about national policy: a plan to be carried out by the country, through the state apparatus. If a Ukrainian in Russia's military comes up with a plan for an offensive, we wouldn't call it \"The Ukrainian offensive operation\".   This confuses and the background of the person is just not relevant. \n\nIf a random American congressman creates a plan to take over the world, it's not representative of anyone else. If this congressman is a Republican, it'd be unfair to call it a \"Republican plot\", unless it had widespread Republican support. Unfair to call it \"America's plan\" if it had no wide backing in America, especially in the government (where power is concentrated). \n\nIf Kamala were to come up with such a plan, would it be \"The African-American plan\"? \"Kamala's plan\" would be better, given it'd be her plan.\n\n\"Morgenthau Plan\" quite accurately describes whose plan it was \u2014 his. Had America's government accepted it, it would then become accurate to describe it as \"America's plan for post-war Germany\", given its national acceptance, in that case. \n\n>Our Christian president at the time stopped a genuine plot by jews to murder 30 million German civilians as retaliation.\n\nThis quote makes it sound as if this is a situation of Christians vs Jews, as opposed to Morgenthau vs anyone else. Now, if there was acceptance of this plan by Jews, but not by Christians, then it could be said to be divided upon religious lines. Otherwise, what precisely is the relevance of mentioning the religion of the president? Is it to imply that had Roosevelt been Jewish, he'd have agreed to the plot? It's unclear. \n\n>Henry Morgenthau Jr. was born into a prominent Jewish family in New York City, the son of Josephine (Sykes) and\u00a0[Henry Morgenthau Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgenthau_Sr.), a real estate mogul and diplomat. His parents were born in Germany.\u00a0\n\nIn other words, born & raised in America. So should we now say: *Our Christian president at the time stopped a genuine plot by Americans to murder 30 million German civilians as retaliation. \u2014* Given that Morgenthau was an American. It is technically correct, but makes it unclear whether \"Americans\" is referring to a couple random guys or a whole part of the population. \n\n*Our president at the time stopped a genuine plot by Morgenthau to murder 30 million German civilians as retaliation.* \u2014 Would definitely be an accurate statement. \n\n*Our president at the time stopped a genuine plot by American Jews to murder 30 million German civilians as retaliation.* \u2014 Could also be an accurate statement, if widespread support for it by Jews is provable.",
