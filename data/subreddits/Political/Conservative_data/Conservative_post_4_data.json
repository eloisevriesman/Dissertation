Harvard Corporation should have acted sooner with more spine.\n\nAnd a few commenters to the article noticed this:\n\n>\u201cBecause the students included as the result of Monday\u2019s amendment are not in good standing, we cannot responsibly vote to award them degrees at this time.\u201d\n\nMeaning that they\u2019ll confer the degrees when this blows over.
