Widely considered the most effective vaccine in use (MMR) are 96% effective against measles, 86% effective against mumps, and 89% effective against rubella.\n\nThe famous polio vaccine that eradicated the disease from the US was  90% effective against Types II and III and 60% effective against Type I\n\nthe most recent COVID vaccine is 54% effective, basically the same as last season's flu shot of 51%",

I am asking those questions so that you realize that you fall directly into the group of people that you are describing.  It is you that is misinformed.\n\n>from George Washington mandating smallpox vaccine in 1777 to present.\n\nWhat is your source that all current service members are required to take the smallpox vaccine?",

It's an important distinction to make because it is not actually effective at all protecting against infection and nor protecting against spread, which was the original justification given for the mandate. It is however consistent with reducing the severity of infection, which is why it is effective against developing symptoms, because most people develop minor to no symptoms anyway. It also ignores the side effects and increased rate of developing other issues, which is well documented and the biggest and real reason most people should not get the covid vaccine, particularly young and healthy adults AKA the military.",
