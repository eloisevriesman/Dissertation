Schools, Jobs and Family vouch for the legal ones. So I assume legal immigrants commit less crime than native citizens but nobody can vouch for illegals because they don\u2019t even exist in our country because they\u2019re undocumented. \n\nWhen is it a moral justification to take in economic migrants? Illegal migrants that are in coming aren\u2019t creating new economic development like my immigrant ancestors did but moving in existing ones and pricing people out with their labor. \n\nMexico isn\u2019t that bad if you\u2019re escaping famine or genocide.
