Conservatives aren't super knowledable about this, so might seem \"dumb\" or \"uneducated\" on these topics.  Conservatives might want to discuss gun control (most gun-control advocates are laughably unknowledable about guns, and conservatives laugh at them about this), or immigration and liberals have very different sets of knowledge on this.\n\nSo giving conservatives more \"education\" might sound good in theory, but unless you're running them through the same sources of education that you've got, they might not come to the same conclusions.

            "body": "Interesting question.\n\nI think it would be very difficult to make the claim that lack of education, ignorance, or even stupidity are the key factor that makes people support right wing policies and politicians in the US. From what I can see, especially over the last 20 year or so, the key motivating factor for Americans on the right is anger, dissatisfaction, and maybe even spite. Sure, poor education contributes to those feelings, but I dont think it is causal. Additionally, I think people on the left need to acknowledge that in some key ways, the anger that motivates people on the right is justifiable, even if we profoundly disagree on the cause of that anger or how to fix it. \n\nPersonally, I don't see access to education, in this context, as all that difference than access to any other resource, like healthcare, social saftey nets, and/or affordable housing. My reading of the current climate is that right wingers are primarily upset due to difficulties with accessing these resources, perceptions that they face difficulties to accessing these resources, and believing that their access to these resources is being threatened by outsiders.\n\nSo, with this in mind, I do think better access to education would make the right significantly different. Not because they would become smart enough to change their views, but that the anger they feel would be diminished and replaced with a degree of civic pride/enthusiasm. Similarly, I would apply that same logic to accessing any vital resource.  \n\nThis is where I think the Democratic party has failed. They are failing to really improve access to resources in the communities where right wingers typically live. Additionally, in some cases, they dont do a good enough job at making sure these communities understand that it is Democratic policy that is giving them access. This is a big reason why I am a communist. We cant lecture the right wing into abandoning their position. We need to actually deliver what they need, where they are at. Once that is done and we can improve their material conditions in a measurable way, we can bring them back from the current wave of reactionary thinking.\n\nFinally, I understand that in many ways it is right wing policy which is destroying their access to resources. I have worked in health care and public schooling for the last 10 years and I find it equal parts frustrating and amusing when right wing families (and they often like to tell everyone just how right wing they are) complain about the horrible state of the systems which their policies destroyed. However, rubbing their noses in it utterly fails to win them over, and infact just makes them more angry, perpetuating the cycle. I am not sure if the cycle is intentional, but if right wing politics and media intentionally built this cycle, it is pretty brilliant.",

Many tried countering with the obvious point that is a graduate level subject primarily for lawyers (and public health in my case) that is not taught at all in elementary school. But still many liberals took the bait, and argued that CRT \"should stay in public school\" inadvertently supporting their claim that it was there to begin with.",
