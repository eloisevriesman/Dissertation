See if they agree or not. If they haven't read it yet, they'll be honest and you can simply state your opinion/convince them. You'll usually find a common ground or you can convince them if you're well read (usually, most people don't have the knowledge to debate/form a believable argument against a well read person), after which you state that it is from project 2025 which is funded and supported by official Republicans. \n\n------------------------------------------\n\nThere's only one thing you need to beware of: Do not lecture them. Debate, question their beliefs and explain your viewpoints. But do not lecture them. You're not in college and you're not talking to a political commentator, you're talking to your familiy. If they're interested, offer them interesting books/papers. But don't try to create a flood of information/facts/stats. It only results in them tuning out and stopping the conversation. \n\nI haven't fully read Project 2025 yet, but what I've read, makes me skeptical to say the least. I don't think they'll be able to pass the legislation they want and I don't think it will be \\*the\\* solution as they present it. \n\ne.g. Capital punishment\n\nCapital punishment is NOT the solution for the rise in crime. I'm a proponent of a quick and painless capital punishment for the most heinous crimes, but it will not be the solution for the rise as they state it. So, basics we agree with but the argument we don't. \n\ne.g. Christian nationalism. \n\nWhy should this even be a policy? The US is not inherently Christian, and christianity is not even one united thing... It has many different variations which don't even agree on basics like the Bible. (Protestants only have 66 books in the Bible.) Why should that be part of a nationalist, unifying agenda? I consider myself a nationalist/regionalist in my own, European country, but it's stupid to place \"Christian\" before it. Many have died over this religious conflict, and now they are going to state that Christianity is a unified or unifying religion? What a joke. (Oh, and what are we going to do with the Jews? Are they not part of this? How does this make the US different from any other religious nationalism?)",
