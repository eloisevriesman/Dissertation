Thanks. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskALiberal) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

The incumbent, LBJ, withdrew from the race.  Eugene McCarthy came in strong as an anti-Vietnam candidate, but was elbowed out of the lane by RFK, who then got shot.  Humphrey was, at best, the fourth best candidate to run against Nixon.",

Of course he lost the electoral vote by large margins but that almost lead to the end of the electoral college and shows he was still competitive despite all the things making it difficult for him",

The question can be reframed as: given their individual things that were negatively impacting their campaigns, who overperformed? With that framing, my ranking from stronger to weaker is:\n\n1) Humphrey. He could have won against Nixon if Vietnam wasn't a thing. Considering how the country and the Democratic Party were in 1968, he actually came very close.\n\n2) Dukakis. Reagan in the White House, Democrats in disarray, and he manages to hold an early lead in the polls against the annoited VP? Pretty respectable in my book.\n\n3) Carter. He was the incumbent in 1980, so the issues the country was facing (Iran, stagflation) were partially his responsibility.",

Robert Caro's literary brilliance has convinced the world that LBJ was the master politician of the era, but it was actually Humphrey who did many of those things.\n\nIt was Humphrey who, in 1948, convinced the DNC to include Civil Rights in their platform.  It was Humphrey who authored the Civil Rights Act of 1964, whipped the votes to pass it, and broke the filibuster against it.  And it was Humphrey who first proposed Medicare and pushed arms control through a reluctant Senate.  \n\nHumphrey came into the 1968 presidential election unexpectedly at the last minute and with every possible disadvantage.  He still finished within a single point of Nixon in the popular vote.",

He lost a lot of his appeal, I'll ignore that again. I guess he was a very good speaker and might have held his own against Reagan on paper, the happy warrior wouldn't be a good foil for Reagan to play his optimism against, but at the same time, the winds had shifted and Carter, who was much more in line with those shifted winds, still lost. Although Humphrey was good at regaining support an unpopular incumbent lost, so it might be close. In 1988, he probably was a bit old, but ignoring that, I don't think he would have won. It was after the Reagan Revolution, and Humphrey was one of the most adamant New Dealers",
