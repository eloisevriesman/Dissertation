There were hiring frenzies in 2018-2019 and a huge one 2021-2023 in which that requirement was dropped by those airlines to account for a bit of a pilot shortage. \n\nThe way airline hiring works, at least at the big airlines, is a points system. Different things on the application are given points values. This includes college, but other things like volunteer work, driving history, general work history, but ESPECIALLY flight hours, flying qualifications, etc. There's a minimum threshold the application has to hit to get a call for an interview. Many places have an aptitude or reasoning test that has to be taken before that point, but after the app gets a response, and if it doesn't hit that, you don't get a call back. Personality tests are also common, though where exactly you take it differs - before the interview, during, etc. One place famously has candidates talk to a psychiatrist, although that occurs at the actual interview.\n\nOnce at the actual interview, the interview generally will include HR and one or two pilots. Sometimes there's an HR interview in advance.  The panel will take notes and make recommendations, and then the final decision will generally be made by a \"blind\" pilot hiring board.\n\nIt's an extremely grueling process. Just getting a call back on your application alone requires A LOT of effort and qualifications. Getting through the actual interview is even tougher, and generally requires spending hundreds of dollars on interview prep, because the airlines can tell who did and didn't do interview prep and if you didn't, they'll consider you as not having tried hard enough. It's a giant fucking gauntlet.\n\nA couple extra points on the application - for example, a DEI initiative thing - only gets you to the interview. It doesn't get you the job. I promise you that nobody is getting hired at AA solely due to their skin color or gender. Anyone who makes it as far as that interview has the qualifications to do the job. And that's *before* you consider how few pilots are minorities, and how few are women. AA, or anyone else, could NEVER staff the airline if they only hired according to a DEI initiative. It's one of the most lily white, and male, industries there is.\n\nTo be completely frank, whoever fed you that about AA has No. Fucking. Idea. what they are talking about.\n\nSource: 5000+TT, 1000+ B737, ATP, CFI/CFII/MEI. \n\nThanks for playing. Try again.",

After multiple attempts at getting my son to meet the pilot when we were traveling to India, I finally got him in a cockpit when we flew Spirit, it weirdly was actually cheaper plus the only flight that worked with our schedule, to Las Vegas.\n\nThe captain was exceedingly nice and was selling my son on the concept of trying to get flight time as soon as possible. He was also very obviously exceedingly proud of the fact that his copilot was a woman, ex-military and very young. \n\nThe whole thing was very funny because my son confronted with an actual plane and not Microsoft flight simulator finally understood how complicated the controls really are when he saw them in person.",

How often do I just feel a kinship with this white woman over here because she has a similar life experience to me rather than the black woman who just moved here? She feels like she would be a better fit because I'm a good fit and this woman is like me, cool.  It's not like people are really even aware of this most of the time, but those things do play a part and taking time to think about it makes you aware of how superficial and paper thin some of the hiring decisions can be.\n\nThe biggest lie is that there is *one objectively better* candidate for most jobs. Nah, there's sooooo much subjectivity in hiring. I once had a manager tell me the tipping point for hiring me over another was that she liked my signature. No, she didn't do handwriting analysis or anything, she just thought it looked cool.",

When I see this discussion come up irl or online, it's almost always a 'more qualified' candidate. \n\nAnd yet your other responses, this response, and the consistent narrative in responses is 'unqualified vs very qualified'. \n\nYou commented on the 'what is bad faith' post yesterday. I don't see how latching onto the 'completely unqualified hire vs most qualified person in the world not hired' narrative isn't a textbook example of bad faith. \n\nNo one is claiming a completely unqualified candidate is getting hired over very qualified candidates.

It's definitely a thing. \n\nBut having a good faith discussion about it,  (ironic because their was a post here the other day asking what bad faith is, and it's *exactly what they're doing on this topic*) would mean they'd have to actually make a cogent argument in defense of it. It's like Schroedinger's DEI. It only exists when they want it to. DEI is necessary, but it also doesn't happen and when it does, it wasn't actual a policy and they were actually the best candidate anyway...\n\nAnd tbf, I'm not even necessarily opposed to it. I get the arguments in favor. At my company, one time I did give in to HR because the discrepancy between the two candidates was small enough that I was fine hiring the black guy. Other times, when the discrepancy was larger, I've stood firm. \n\nThe whole thing is indicative of how our society communicates. Good faith discussions are nigh on impossible.",

This means appointments should *intentionally* select people based on their identity group memberships.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I'm a fan of proportional representation used in other forms of government, rather than our system, which magnifies majorities, and incentivizes gerrymandering.\n\n>It's ok when we do it\" should really be the leftist motto.\n\nI just don't think you understand what people are saying. It is possible to believe both of these things at the same time: \n\n1. Employment should be based on qualifications and people shouldn't have the opportunity to be racist or sexist against candidates so as to perpetuate societal inequality and injustice.\n2. Appointments to positions of power should be made with consideration of representation of the American people. \n\nSince we probably agree on (1), we can enshrine that in law and criminalize violations of it when they happen. That's basically what this whole post is about. Discriminating on race in hiring is illegal even though many conservatives have been misled into thinking it's rampant.\n\nBut since (2) isn't that, we're not going to agree on the best principles to use in appointing people to positions and power within our government, and since the authority for how appointments work is in the Constitution, and the Constitution does not prescribe a certain way that we need to qualify or select people for the role, the best we can do is be mad when it doesn't look the way we want it to look and do the things the Constitution says we can do to fix it. Trump can make a point to say \"I am going to make it a point to nominate a *white* candidate\" and it would be exactly the same conversation. I'm sure liberals would be upset at that, and might question his motives for doing so, but ultimately the Constitution grants him that ability, right?\n\nSome voters vote on the basis of race. If these votes become deciding votes, did the American people engage in illegal employment discrimination? How do we remedy that?\n\nLike can you give me any plausible way you imagine we could enforce employment law against a Supreme Court Justice nomination? Would a candidate that wasn't chosen file an EEOC complaint? What would an EEOC response look like? If you imagine this is criminal discrimination, who would be charged with the crime? The President? The Senate? The voters for voting for someone that said they would appoint someone that way?",

Conservatives see things like \"diversity goals\" and go straight to \"the only way I imagine that could be done is racial discrimination\", so that becomes the conservative narrative despite no evidence that that's actually happening.\n\nSo yes, discriminating against someone in employment decisions on the basis of race is wrong and (already) illegal.\n\nBut that's not what diversity or DEI mean.",

You should talk to your HR team or your company's employment lawyers before you continue to make false statements about your employer's hiring practices. \n\nRacial quotas of any kind are illegal. You cannot use race as a factor in hiring decisions for any reason whatsoever\\*. Not for racism, not for diversity, not for achieving representation in your workforce. The hiring process must evaluate all candidates that apply for a position without regard to their race, gender, or membership in any other protected class.\n\nAny EEOC-mandated affirmative action plans are about correcting past instances of illegal employment discrimination, but even these plans cannot simply result in the employer discriminating \"back\". Racial quotas are illegal, even in affirmative action plans, even if those are mandatory.\n\n>If we have two candidates, one diverse and less qualified, and one non-diverse but more qualified, we are to consider hiring the former, to increase the diversity of the firm.\n\nThis is illegal employment discrimination and you should report this to the EEOC.

Racial quotas are illegal employment discrimination, whether done for diversity or correcting past racism. You cannot refuse to hire someone based on their race and you cannot set aside positions. Your source clearly says this.\n\nWhat you can do is have abstract goals, and you meet these goals through things that are **not** selecting black candidates over white candidates. You do targeted recruiting, you clean up your GlassDoor complaints, you de-bias your promotion and retention processes, you fire the racist hiring manager that got you into that mess to begin with. You achieve diversity in hiring by achieving a diverse pool of candidates.\n\nPlease stop repeating misinformation before you talk to an employment lawyer. Your company probably already has one on staff or retainer. Just get 5 minutes with them and ask this question.

Even if you don't buy into the different perspectives/diversity for its own sake stuff it's still the case that it's sometimes not entirely clear who is \"more qualified.\"\n\nI think a lot conservatives got pretty upset when Biden announced his next Supreme Court justice nomination would be a woman of color. The obvious complaint would be that he should chose instead the most qualified candidate. That's all well and good at surface level but then it begs the question- who exactly would be the most qualified guy? Would it be person who spent the most time at the best law school? Would it be the guy who's made the most rulings or presided over the most trials? Maybe whoever the oldest law clerk is? \n\nEducation and experience are obviously good metrics to evaluate judges. But it's not clear to me that they alone point to the very objective and clear \"best\" candidate. I'd imagine at any given time there's quite a few people who are more or less qualified to fill a given role- which is probably why a lot of liberals like me didn't particularly worry too much when Biden made this announcement. \n\nA lot of people have been asking for more concrete examples. If DEI type stuff is obviously keeping more qualified people out of jobs I'd find that pretty distressing, but instead if people are taking diversity into consideration when selecting from a pool of roughly equally qualified candidates I don't find that nearly as controversial.

Companies are choosing voluntarily to enact DEI policies.  So, unless you think that multinational companies worldwide have all collectively decided to hire unqualified people, thereby damaging their own profitability, for no good reason... yes, there is something you're missing.  Anytime you wonder why a publicly traded company is doing essentially *anything*, the answer is \"because they believe it will increase profitability\".  The idea that any big company, anywhere, is doing something that they know will hurt their bottom line, for no gain... that is a huge claim that requires commensurate evidence.\n\nDiversity in corporations is proven to reduce blind spots, increase innovation, and make the company better able to function.

Intentionally have people expand their LinkedIn networks (most people's professional networks look like them).\n4. Scrutinize their hiring process to eliminate any form of bias that might have unintentionally crept in. This might involve things like blinding resumes so that resume reviewers don't have anything to exhibit unconscious bias against. \n5. Make the workplace the kind of place their employees of color recommend to their professional networks.\n\nDoing these kinds of things results in a higher fraction of applicants being people of color, women, etc. If the rest of your hiring process is unbiased, this means you will end up with a diverse (or representative) workforce.\n\n>does this leave more qualified applicants left out?\n\nIt shouldn't, no. Nothing about the process I'm describing above includes any kind of racial quotas for preference given in the actual hiring process itself.

Didn't he in the end put in more work, and therefore deserve the job more? Or is there some underlying factor that I am failing to grasp?\n\nIn the example that you provided, the only disparity between the two people was a couple years of college. Whether those two years matters to an employer depends on the job.   \n\nDEI policies at companies simply are not about hiring people based on race/gender/sexual preference regardless of their experience. They are about promoting an inclusive and diverse workplace. \n\nMy company does this well. For hiring practices, managers are not encouraged to hire certain people over others. Rather they are encouraged to reach out to those communities and broaden the pool of applicants. We also have groups that meet to discuss issues related to race/gender/sexuality/disability. Anyone is free to join any of those groups, and they are a great way to network and to learn about the needs and experiences of that group. \n\nIt helps to improve the work environment and make all people feel more included. My industry was historically white cis male dominated, so that is actually an important thing. If people who are not part of the main group at your company, they may not even apply there for fear of being isolated. Having a DEI policy encourages people from more communities to want to work there, and increases your potential pool of candidates. \n\nIn the end, it is literally a good business decision to have these policies.  It is hard to find good people to staff a company, and working with a larger pool of applicants really helps. And managers will absolutely not use those policies to hire a black lesbian over a white cis male if the black lesbian is significantly less qualified. Managers do not want to hire people unless they know they will be able to do the job and improve their team.",

The fact is that more people get hired for stable well-paying jobs through networking and connections more than they do by cold resume submissions on places like LinkedIn. And when, for most of history, the people in a position to hire through those connections are white people, that means white people have an unfair advantage in being hired for well-paying jobs, and something needs to be done to correct for the racial biases. A white person in upper management is more likely to network and connect with other people who have lived in his/her circles, grown up in the same neighborhood as them, went to the same school as them, and for most white people in America, those are other white people. That's how its been for most of history (and some research shows that neighbors and schools today are even more segregated than they were in the 60s)\n\nIf you don't want the solution to this problem to be \"DEI hiring\" then what other solutions are there?",

Saying that is against the civil rights act is a joke.\n\nPoor example because something like this is an express exception to the Civil Rights Act.\n\n>Title VII of the Act . . . prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race . . . . In very narrowly defined situations, an employer is permitted to discriminate on the basis of a protected trait if the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.\"\n\nYou are referring to a BFOQ - i.e., someone of a different race literally cannot perform the job. Jobs like that are very rare and there is reason why you had to go to entertainment to find it, rather than something like, I don't know, the entire financial or tech sectors?\n\nI'm sure your next move will be to claim being X race is BFOQ because the company needs diversity. Under that logic, McDonalds would be justified to refuse any employment of blacks in racist towns because it would likely increase their operating income there.

Have you seen it, in person, put in practice? I can only think of these isolated cases when I think of it.\n\nI have many friends of different races, and they have never had any issues getting a job based on race. Many of them are extremely well-off too. This issue is a made-up point for a liberal Democrat's voting campaign. liberals constantly call the Republicans racist because we don't see other races as above us.\n\nStating this does not automatically mean we look down on them. we look them in the eyes as fellow human beings, not gods. We don't sacrifice for them because they are capable human beings. They are equals. There ARE cases of racist Republicans, but that does not make all republicans racists. If you believe that, you believe a stereotype, something you are so adamant against. I call it hypocrisy.\n\nSame as politicians, both sides included, saying to do one thing and doing the complete opposite. This leads back to the discrimination. If it keeps being pushed, racism will loop around, as more and more advantages are given to minorities, and suddenly it is the whites who are being discriminated against.\n\nThis is my issue. I want my children to be equal to their fellow Americans, whether Black, Latino, Asian, Native, or Indian. This is not about myself, I can deal with my own crap. I don't want my children to grow up how a black child grew up in the 50s, I want them to grow up and not make friends based upon race, but instead upon the person themself. Not to have them spit on for existing.\n\nIt is like losing traction while driving. A slight turn will allow you to recover your car, but if you over-correct it you end up in a ditch. I believe this is where our society is going. You can say whatever you want about the white man's skin, and no one gives a damn. Then try saying it about a black man. You will get canceled. Ruined. You are suddenly known as a racist and hated. This is what concerns me.",
