Which is probably a mild version of stagflation. \n\nSo you can say the number is arbitrary but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s circumstance dependent. In circumstances when you\u2019re experiencing high unemployment and low growth, you\u2019re fine lowering your FFR and you\u2019re okay with relatively higher inflation, but when your employment and inflation is already high and you\u2019re expecting it to come down, you\u2019re never going to set your target to 3 or something higher",

One central banker in New Zealand in an offhand comment said that there\u2019s some ideal inflation target \u201clike 2%\u201d that got publicized and central banks made it an unofficial, then official policy to always target 2% inflation.\u00a0\n\nThat specific target, 2% is arbitrary.\u00a0\n\nIt would be better policy to have targets based on circumstance. If getting to 3 means getting to a situation where wages can grow faster than inflation, but getting down to 2 means a recession, unemployment and a poorer populace, then dont make 2 your goal.\u00a0\n\nIn the opposite situation if getting to 1.5 means you can raise incomes and increase workforce participation, but getting to 2 means you have to bankrupt the country with huge stimulus even though unemployment is already low, then there\u2019s no point in that extra cost to get to 2.\u00a0\n\nEdit: tl;dr: 2% is ideal in some circumstances. But not all circumstances. The fact that we decided on 2% as the overall target in all cases was an arbitrary event in history.\u00a0",

But, full disclosure, I\u2019ve not taken any economics since grad school.\n\n> Corporate price gouging has not been a primary driver of U.S. inflation, according to research published on Monday by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\n\nArticle thesis statement. Doesn\u2019t seem to be saying that greedflation isn\u2019t a thing, but that it\u2019s not the *primary* driver of inflation for the country.\n\n> While markups for motor vehicles and petroleum products did rise sharply during the 2021-2022 inflation surge, markups across the entire spectrum of U.S. goods and services have been relatively flat during the post-pandemic recovery, the bank's latest Economic Letter showed.\n\nWas the argument that corporations were *continually* raising prices at an exorbitant rate, or that they raised prices a lot to deal with sudden COVID expenses *and then did not lower the prices once those expenses were no longer on the balance sheet.*\n\nThat\u2019s a very different accusation. Prices are going to keep going up with inflation, but if there\u2019s still that COVID bump in the base price, but no longer the COVID expense in production, people call foul.\n\n> \u201cAs such, rising markups have not been a main driver of the recent surge and subsequent decline in inflation during the current recovery,\" wrote the bank's research chief Sylvain Leduc and colleagues Huiyu Li and Zheng Liu.\n\nThis also seems to be addressing the idea that corporations are continually and over time adding price bumps out of pure greed, versus the idea that they\u2019re just keeping the COVID bump in the price, even though they no longer have the same COVID expenses.\n\n> U.S. President Joe Biden has blamed corporate greed for still-elevated prices, accusing companies of boosting profits by shrinking portion sizes but leaving the selling price unchanged, and by failing to pass on falling costs to consumers.\n\n*That.* That\u2019s what I\u2019ve understood \u201cgreedflation\u201d to be\u2014the still-elevated prices that take into account COVID expenses like constant sanitation and installing sanitizer machines and paying for more sick leave and for emergency hires. Those aren\u2019t on the balance sheet anymore, but the cost is still passed to the consumer.\n\n> Fed policymakers, and many economists, say the inflation surge can be better explained by the combined effect of supply chain disruptions and a drop in labor supply during the post-pandemic recovery that occurred just as consumer demand rose.\n\nExactly. And that disruption has passed, as has the worst of the pandemic. But prices are still set as though corporations were hemorrhaging cash to deal with COVID. \n\n> Leduc and his colleagues did not refer to Biden or use the colloquial term 'greedflation,' but their work was a clear rebuttal of the theory that corporate profiteering has been a main cause of higher prices. \n\nNot a main cause is still not the same thing as \u201cnot a thing.\u201d\n\n> \u201cData for the current recovery show that the increase in corporate profits is not particularly pronounced compared with previous recoveries,\" the San Francisco Fed researchers wrote. \"Markups also have not played much of a role in the slowing of inflation since the summer of 2022.\"\n\nAnd just because we *usually* see a greedflation factor during recoveries (the rich always get richer in emergencies) doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a thing to be concerned about.\n\nAll told, the study seems to be concluding that greedflation is not the *primary* cause of inflation, not that it\u2019s just flatly not a thing.",

My orders from Dyson didn\u2019t change due to the increase in price, so why *wouldn\u2019t* I keep the price as it was? It\u2019s all extra profit for me.\n\nIf no-one else does this, the vacuum cleaner will still be 20% more expensive than it was because of my profit gouging. Best Buy might not make an extra 20% on the sale, but I am. If every provider in the chain does this, you end up with a product that is 30% more expensive despite being smaller, despite the retailer themselves not changing their markup percentage (though ultimately making more money because the markup is a percentage not a flat fee). \n\nIt\u2019s also self-fulfilling. Thinks inflate in cost, so I put my prices up. But when my parts come down in cost, the fact that all the things I buy for my everyday needs have inflated in cost means I\u2019m even less incentivised to drop my prices. \n\nThen people stop buying Dyson vacuums because their price has inflated so much. So my filter orders slow. I\u2019m left with the choice of dropping my prices to try and get more orders, expanding my business to other vacuum companies, or increasing my prices further to make up for the shortfall in revenue and profit.\n\nLet\u2019s say I have shareholders in my vacuum filter business\u2026 I have a fiduciary duty to make them more money. So I either drop prices a little and hope to sell more, or I increase the price further and hope the increased price makes up for a smaller sales volume.\n\nThis is where we\u2019re at now, with Target reporting a drop in sales and therefore dropping prices on many items to try and get people back in the store and buying again.",

Just because a company\u2019s reported profits are increasing doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re increasing prices more than their costs. Most companies record their inventory, and therefore their costs of sales, on a FIFO system, so their reported costs are much lower than their actual costs when inflation is rising.

The same with all of our suppliers.\n\n--------\n\n>Lol we posted miserable 1.6 the 1st quarter of 2024. That\u2019s one of the historic lows\n\nThat is *growth*. If we are above capacity and the economy *grows*, we can stay above capacity. (This is part of why so many people were certain we would need a recession to defeat inflation.)\n\nWe *might* be able to defeat inflation while growing, but requires increases in capacity, which don't comes easily.",

Human behavior is unpredictable on the micro level, but is somewhat predictable on the macro level. \n\nThat's what makes economics \"soft\". There's \"laws\" in economics but they're not *really laws* because of the it still just being an interpretation of human behavior. If you hit a ball with a hammer, it's going to act the same way given the conditions every single time. The same input will basically always give the same output. That's not true of the soft sciences.\n\nEven with your examples...\n\n> Would you switch to a different company if they paid you $10 per hour more? \n\nI absolutely wouldn't because my QoL and seniority are very good and I like my corporate culture.\n\nBut raising pay in general is an effective way to increase staffing, because the calculus for other people is different. \n\nThat unpredictability is what makes it soft.",

Did workers? \n\nTo be clear, this nine percent number is from select companies--the 100 most highly-paid CEOs that *also* files data with the SEC--not exactly the most robust cross-section.  On top of that, the 9 percent increase does not refer to pay, but rather remuneration.  This could be from the employer's health insurance premium contribution, it could be reimbursing the CEO for flights (as air travel picked up in 2022), contractually mandated bonuses, etc.\n\n>If the price raises you mention as a \u201cbuffer\u201d (in other words greed, taking more than you need at the moment in case you need it later) went to workers after the fact, Id like to see proof of that, because nothing Ive seen reflects that. Cost of living has skyrocketed, workers wages have not kept up.\n\nSure--there's no dearth of information:  while [this write-up](https://www.dallasfed.org/cd/communities/2022/0808) uses nominal wages, they do note that real wages have increased recently, with the biggest gains in wage growth going to the lowest-paid workers.  Even as more current data shows the job market cooling and real wages rising at a more modest rate (but still [rising](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker#)), labor is in a much better position than it was two years ago.  \n\nThe rising wages is why we had such a tight labor market and for so long--even as it's loosening, it's still below four percent.  Not every company is going to be content with the status quo--they want the best employees, and will shell out money; they poach from other companies.  Then those have to raise their wages to attract new employees and retain their old ones.  After a time of high inflation, most companies don't have much of a choice but to raise wages.",

Retirements, quits, etc. *always* can have an affect on the data.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned, this was an earlier analysis (I thought write-up was pretty good though).  If you look at the data in the other link, you can see that it was generally sustained past the time the article was written--suggesting that the effects of the COVID-era were not the main source for the data, though it obviously played some role.  Even though wages are growing at a slower rate, they are still rising faster than inflation for all quartiles.\n\nCanada is seeing a much softer recovery than the United States in many aspects, and wages have not as much as they have in the US.  It's also worth mentioning that inequality in the US dropped in 2022, and it's believed to have done the same in 2023, though the latter years' numbers have not been confirmed yet, to my knowledge.",

Soon prices started to increase for products where there weren't even shortages when people were willing to pay those prices.\n\nCouple that with significant pent-up demand following the lockdowns, and we now have demand that is higher than pre-pandemic levels, coupled with less supply than before (a perfect storm for high inflation), along with some labor market disruptions. A lot of people (not everybody, but many) had more money to spend than before (from raises, unemployment/government-assistance programs, shifts in labor demand and sharp increases in tech hiring, increased liquidity from the feds being pumped into various parts of the economy, etc), and that meant that there was less market resistance to price increases than there was before.\n\nIt was a perfect storm. More demand coupled with less supply created macroeconomic conditions that were ripe for inducing lamentably sharp price increases. Inflation didn't really settle down until there was enough market pressure from price increases to eventually create a drop in demand, in tandem with improving a lot of the supply chain issues that were a major catalyst to this whole situation to begin with.\n\nQuite a lot of it was covid-induced.",

It is almost *inevitable* that we would face higher prices as a result.\n* **Inflation Expectations:** Bizarrely, one thing that causes inflation is the [expectation](https://old.reddit.com/user/othelloinc/) of inflation.\n* **Demographic Changes (labor):** As the Baby Boomers enter retirement, the workforce is losing our biggest generation ever; we should expect a drop in productivity as a result.\n* **Demographic Changes (capital):** Also, those of them with retirement savings are probably moving into risk-averse investments. That could lead to decreased investment where it is needed most. Imagine a businessman saying 'the price of X is so high, right now; I should invest in producing more X' but struggling to find the money to make that investment.\n* **Housing is the everything problem:** More people and jobs are in denser urban areas, and near-zero of them have built enough housing to meet demand. Until the housing supply increases, that problem will persist.\n* **Service sector wages are increasing:** The low unemployment rate is leading service-sector employers to raise wages in an attempt to outbid each other. (This is arguably a good thing, but it will almost certainly raise prices to some extent.)\n* **Strong job growth:** Low unemployment means everyone has money in their pockets. The more money we have, the more likely we are to still buy something, even after the price went up!",

In general, if productivity doesn't keep up with the printing of currency, you'll get inflation, but some of it is still natural and 3.5% vs a 2% target really isn't bad. You can still have the government spend and not get unusual inflation - general economic productivity just has to keep up with minting of currency.",
