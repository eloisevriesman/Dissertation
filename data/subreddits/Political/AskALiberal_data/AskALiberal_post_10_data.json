And apparently that\u2019s not an American thing, it\u2019s the entire world.\n\nHowever, your comment reminds me of the time that my father was really upset while in India that everybody in the city he grew up in was able to figure out that he was an American, most of the time before he even opened his mouth and revealed that he spoke his mother tongue with New York accent. \n\nMy uncle told him that he shouldn\u2019t be surprised because he walks around as if the US Army is standing behind him.",

I understand that bullets can be small and not always easy to find in folds/pockets in bags, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019re impossible to clear out either.

No. That\u2019s excessive, and if it looks like any of them would actually be punished to that extent the government should intervene for leniency.

Also no. \n\nI\u2019m a semi-regular shooter (now pretty much only go when I\u2019m visiting my parents for a variety of reasons) but I\u2019ve used my backpack as a range bag  and then subsequently used that backpack as a carry on multiple times and I\u2019ve never accidentally taken a gun or ammunition with me to the airport. If there\u2019s one thing everyone should always exercise proper care with, it\u2019s firearms and ammunition. That\u2019s what I was taught by my gun-loving father, grandfather, and uncles - owning and using firearms is a right, but one which comes with an obligation to use, store, and transport them safely and responsibly.\n\nTl;dr: 12 years punishment based on what I know of these cases is excessive, and to the extent that it looks like any of these people will actually be subjected to that punishment the government should attempt to intervene for leniency, but these people all broke the law and their only excuse is carelessness, which doesn\u2019t cut it for me to exonerate them completely.",

No reasonable human being could support that prosecution.  It is ridiculous that the state department has to even get involved.  If the prosecutor was a decent human being and not a monster devoid of morality they would have just refused to file charges.  That's a miscarriage of justice on the level of what happens in countries like Iran, not what you'd expect from a country like the UK.\n\nShit, we don't even know for sure that the ammo was theirs.  For all we know, they bought a used duffel bag someone previously used to go to the firearm range and they just didn't see a round or two of ammunition in it.\n\nThis story is completely ridiculous.  And that they're choosing to victimize FIVE people for clear accidents?  Something stinks in that customs office.",

Every US passport reminds travelers that they will be bound by the laws of the country they are in, and that punishments can be significantly more severe. You and I can go round and round on whether or not it\u2019s fair to need to be that careful, but whether it\u2019s fair or not is kinda beside the point, because it\u2019s what is, and there\u2019s not a ton that can be done about that. If a country wants to make something illegal on a strict liability basis and has harsh punishments for it, that\u2019s a signal that you need to be on your toes when you go there, and if that\u2019s going to be a problem, maybe travel elsewhere. It\u2019s not fair, but that\u2019s life. Brittney griner should have been more careful to not bring marijuana derived products to Russia. These 5 people should have been more careful to not bring ammunition to Turks and Caicos. Griner\u2019s punishment, and these 5 people\u2019s potential punishments, are/would be unjust, and the government was correct to work to free griner and would be correct to try to intervene on these people\u2019s behalf, but they all undertook actions that made it possible for the punishment to apply at all. This all could have been avoided if a little more care had been taken, and that\u2019s a fact.",

It is so ridiculous that no one who is a thinking individual could possibly argue in favor of such a miscarriage of justice.\n\nAlso, counterpoint: since you aren't a gun owner and don't know what you're talking about, you should probably listen to people who do.  This would be a different conversation if they'd smuggled a pistol into the country, but missing a round in a bag after a range day is absolutely something that happens and happens regularly.  Yeah, people should be more assiduous when sweeping their bags, but shit happens to everyone and if you're going to treat someone like a felon, there needs to be intent, not a good faith effort to follow the law.",

After all, their economy heavily relies on tourism. They probably don't want to get a reputation for sentencing tourists to a decade of hard labor over careless mistakes. There are plenty of other islands around there to visit.\n\nPerhaps we can work something out where these folks can pay a fine, make some form of restitution, issue an apology, or something.
