            "body": "The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.\n\nSo there's something that's been troubling me a lot over the past few months.\n\nHow much democratic control actually exists over the federal bureaucracy? I.e. how much policy is actually set by unelected bureaucrats?\n\nSee, here's the thing. A couple months back I watched this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWxh2oS7Ays&t=20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWxh2oS7Ays&t=20s)\n\nAnd I found it fascinating. I've also spent a great deal of time over the past few months reading up on various abuses of federal power during the cold war and war on terror, which has helped drive me to be a touch paranoid lol.\n\nThis lack of democratic oversight and the strong influence of the federal bureaucracy on actual decision making is something that's fundamentally anti-democratic no? Career bureaucrats building empires within their own departments and \"advising\" the politicians that we elect to help them in that quest.\n\nI mean, the old british sitcom *Yes Minister* is based around slight exaggerations of true stories from the british government and its civil service and it's shocking the extent to which the civil service influences democratic policy via empire building.\n\nMy dad is a right libertarian and he's convinced that the civil service and broader federal bureaucracy really is a \"deep state\" that sets policy outside of democratic oversight (and cause he's a right wing shit head, of course that means that they were just anti-trump). But like... he does kind of have a point. Federal bureaucrats did actively thwart a number of trump's policies. And, like, that's obviously a good thing in the short term cause those policies were terrible. But like.... I'm not generally a fan of bureaucrats snatching documents off a president's desk so they don't sign them (though I'm also not a fan of a president who forgets about documents unless they are literally in front of him).\n\nA big part of project 2025 is the idea that the federal bureaucracy should more or less be under the direct control of the president. Now, obviously, that's bad as well because it invests a whole lot of power in the hands of the executive and that could very very easily be abused. I mean it's basically an elected dictator (and dictators don't tend to tolerate elections long anyways).\n\n  \nWhat I am wondering about though is: what actually is the right answer here? We shouldn't have bureaucrats setting policy without democratic oversight regardless of who is president. Empire building, corporations funding and regulating themselves via regulatory capture, all of that is like... bad.\n\nAnd I'm not really sure what the actual solution is. Would it be better to transform the experts into advisory roles rather than in charge of actually implementing rules and then we could have elected councils to implement these rules? (So the EPA itself wouldn't set regulations, instead it would recommend them and then these would be voted on by subcouncils of elected delegates. You could hand this job to congress but given they only work for like half the year i doubt they'll be willing to do it). I'm not really sure.\n\n  \ntl;dr: How do we ensure the civil service doesn't interfere with democratic decision making? The examples of this interference are most egregious in the realm of foreign policy and national security, but bureaucratic empire building can be seen in every level of the federal bureaucracy no? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "The Federal bureaucracy is actually one of the few areas of government where the US gets it mostly right.  The various executive departments are overseen by Cabinet secretaries, who along with deputy and assistant secretaries, are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  Cabinet secretaries who have lost the confidence of the President are typically asked to resign.  \n\nCareer executive branch employees deal in matters too technical for elected or appointed officials to have the requisite expertise in.  But they also don't actually make any decisions.  Information flows up the chain of command and decisions flow down. Those decisions are ultimately made by a Senate-confirmed presidential appointee or the President himself.\n\nThe way all this stuff works is strikingly similar to how major corporations operate, but right-wing cranks would have you think it is all from outer space.  Do public companies put every manager- or director- level hire to a shareholder vote, much less every decision made by those employees?  Of fucking course not.",

Are you entirely comfortable with that lack of democratic accountability?\n\nIt's not unaccountable at all.  If an agency issues a new rulemaking, those with standing have the right to sue and the Courts get involved.  Congress also has the power to overturn rulemakings it does not like under the Congressional Review Act.\n\nEach executive branch department has an independent Inspector General who has the job of investigating the department to find waste, bad actors (including illegal action), etc.  The Government Accountability Office does reports on how effective agencies are at different things.  Congress also has an Oversight Committee in each the House and the Senate that can investigate what they want, as well as other committees that can do the same for agencies under their purview.\n\nIt's also worth noting that these agencies were created with the power that they have because of bills passed by both houses in Congress and signed by the president.\n\n>I mean look at the shit the CIA or FBI gets up to. Hell, the CIA hacked Dianne Feinstein's laptop WHILE SHE WAS INVESTIGATING THEM. That's clearly not good.\n\nYes, that is bad. And we know about it because Congress told us, both in hearings and through a 6,000 page report, IG investigations, oversight boards, etc., instead of just being ignored.\n\nBad things are always going to happen.  It's the reaction to those bad things that makes a difference.\n\n>And like, fuck Trump and all, but are you honestly comfortable with bureaucrats setting policy by snatching papers or intentionally undermining presidential directives? I mean where is the actual accountability for that right?\n\nDepends on the type of agency.  Independent agencies, for example, are designed explicitly to not follow the orders of the President or Congress, because those agencies have much more expertise in what they do.\n\n>It's not neccessarily about the cabinet secretaries but the guys below them. Cabinet secretaries have a modicum of accountability, but the guys in the video were not cabinet secretaries or ever appointed by any democratic body right?\n\nMany undersecretaries are appointed by the president and confirmed by Senate--these usually go very smoothly and quickly, and there's so many at the beginning of a new presidential term that there's not enough time to report on them all.\n\nBut political appointees can be removed or fired.  It takes a little more time for everyone else, but anyone in the federal bureaucracy for not doing their job.",

And that's the point. That's all this is. A back door to destroying a functioning government.\n\nIt's not really about \"trusting experts\". It's about the lack of democratic oversight within the enforcement and regulatory apparatus of state. It's not GoVeRnMeNt BaD or whatever. I'm just deeply uncomfortable with a large unaccountable body of people setting policy which have effectively no democratic oversight, like our CIA official previously mentioned.\n\nChuck Schumer himself once said that going after the IC is dumb cause they have 6 ways to sunday to take you down. And that's like.... really fucking bad. We can see the CIA hacked Dianne Feinstein's laptop while she was investigating them. I mean like..... that's fundamentally anti-democratic right?\n\nMy focus here is on the CIA, FBI, and other intelligence agencies, but you can still see this sort of bureaucratic empire building elsewhere (it's just most egregious with the IC).\n\n>I don't give a flying fuck if the person that sets seat belt safety standards is elected. I care that they did the math.\n\nI mean sure, but at the same time that's not really my concern. My general concern is that the civil service undermines democratic mandates by trying to maintain a status quo or expanding their departments. That's why I mentioned *Yes Minister*, as it tells many many stories like that.\n\nFor example, one of the episodes details a hospital that has no patients but is kept open because of civil service corruption. That's a problem right?\n\n>And our elected officials?

The captain oversees professionals who will work together to steer the ship in the direction the voters have chosen.\n\nBut imagine if the voters were micromanaging every single decision on this ship. They vote to turn the wheel clockwise but also to turn the rudder to starboard. They vote to randomly raise and lower sails on whims. They vote to drop the anchor too early sometimes and too late other times. Such a ship is unlikely to get anywhere close to its course, and it runs a high risk of getting stuck or sinking altogether.",

What are you talking about? It's true that individual people may not have the knowledge to govern on specific issues, but that's why we have experts play an ADVISORY role. Let the tradeoffs of any particular regulation be known and the people decide whether it's worth engaging in for the cost.\n\n\n\n>But imagine if the voters were micromanaging every single decision on this ship. They vote to turn the wheel clockwise but also to turn the rudder to starboard.\n\nI mean this already happens within the federal bureaucracy. I'll give an example I'm fairly familiar with. The DEA kept catching coke smugglers and having to let them go. Why? Because they were working for the CIA in Iran-Contra. The FBI had to do a similar thing with various different test subjects and aides to the MK ULTRA program.\n\nThe CIA and FBI literally hate each other because they're always stepping over one another in initiatives (you should see some of the shit Hoover said about Bill Donovan, it goes far back in their respective histories, since before the CIA was even formed and it was still the OSS).",
