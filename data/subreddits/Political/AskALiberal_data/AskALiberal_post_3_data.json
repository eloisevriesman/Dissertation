Katie Britt would be another good prospect along those lines, maybe Kristi Noem given that the dog thing will inevitably blow over.",

Someone who will make the MAGA people happy and agree to anything Trump says without any thought at all.  In Trump's mind if Pence had done that he would still be president, so I can't see him picking anyone with a backbone again.  \n\nIf he's trying to win over the moderates, then he needs to pick someone that isn't MAGA, and will show people there's hope for normalcy.  I'd assume that person would be Haley, since she seems to be the most well known Republican that is capable of human thought and will at least question \"Hey, should I just appoint this guy dictator?\"",

He learned from his first administration that you can\u2019t choose people who actually value democracy, or have any patriotism or think that the rule of law is more important than individual objectives of Donald Trump. \n\nHe cannot have a John Kelly or Jeff Sessions.

Nikki Haley possibly could sway some voters, but she could also be seen as a sellout, and it might be a hard sell to his base. Tulsi Gabbard was formerly a dreaded democrat, and that could scare some Republicans off. I feel like Noem was the shoe-in until she announced to the world she's a puppy murderer.",
