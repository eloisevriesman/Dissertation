            "body": "The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.\n\nPeople talk about Trump trying to seize power in the 2020 election, that he wants to be a dictator, but all I ever see them reference is inciting the riot/insurrection on January 6. That was pretty messed up, but it could be argued in court that he did t specifically try to stop the election. \n\nHowever, the [fake elector plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot) was such a blatant attempt to steal the election, and he was more obviously and directly involved. It was undeniable election fraud on an incredible scale, seven key states in a presidential election. He has been indicted, and he is arguing he should be immune, but it seems to get little to no attention, at least in my circles on Reddit and in life. It seems so damning.\n\nWhen people are trying to explain why Trump is treasonous, or has aims to be a dictator, or is wrong about Democrats cheating the election, why isn\u2019t this always the first piece of evidence? Why, unlike 1/6, do I never hear about it? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There's no good footage to show the fake elector plot, whereas there is footage of people breaking windows and making asses of themselves on January 6. It's simply a matter of what gets through to the average person.",

Doubly so if there is any level of nuance behind it (e.g. legalities, shades of grey, etc). \n\nThe Democrats have long suffered from this dynamic. Although there's a lot more to it, this is one of the reasons they don't do well with non-degree holders. What I don't understand is why they don't hire people to help them message more effectively. The Lincoln Project has shown it's possible. Now if only someone who isn't a disaffected Republican can learn those skills",

Rich friends from my MBA days who like the people who keep their taxes and regulations on their businesses low. This one is obvious and not who we're discussing.\n2. Lower class to middle class people who grew up being told they were Christian and that they vote Republican. Their entire family is the same as is most of their social circle. They have zero incentive to question their lifelong beliefs, much less risk othering themselves from their friends and family.",

Democrats chose their electors before the elections.

I mean, that\u2019s what they do in a normal election when everything is proper. \n\n\nWhat is illegal is sending a fake Certificate of Ascertainment to the Senate and to the Archivist - stating that you party\u2019s Electors won and they elect so and so, if in fact your party did not get the majority / plurality vote. \n\n\nIf you look at those that have already been successfully prosecuted with regards to this - they have all been charged with some variation of forgery, falsifying documents and conspiracy to do so. \n\n\nThe thing is - Trump didn\u2019t actually forge or falsify anything. What he did was hear about the scheme from Eastman and what he did was claim there was election fraud. \n\n\nThat\u2019s a big leap from hearing about a scheme to proving that Trump was involved in orchestrating it. \n\n\nNow I get that liberals might think it\u2019s no big leap but most States disagree which is why even the States that did charge others for the scheme like Michigan, Nevada and Arizona did not also otherwise charge Trump. Because unlike the others charged, Trump wasn\u2019t directly involved. \n\n\nBut Georgia has charged Trump. And in that case Trump\u2019s defense is admitting that they heard about the scheme from Eastman. But they never sanctioned forgery or falsification of certificates. Anyway - that case is still pending. \n\n\nAll that said - it\u2019s difficult to say Trump is guilty of such when the whole innocent until guilty thing exists and the one case that pertains to it hasn\u2019t resulted in a conviction yet.\n\n\nAll of the above doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m saying Trump is morally blameless.

This preference has traditionally rested on an organic conception of society\u2014that is, on the belief that society is not merely a loose collection of individuals but a living organism comprising closely connected, interdependent members. Conservatives thus favour institutions and practices that have evolved gradually and are manifestations of continuity and stability. Government\u2019s responsibility is to be the servant, not the master, of existing ways of life, and politicians must therefore resist the temptation to transform society and politics. This suspicion of government activism distinguishes conservatism not only from radical forms of political thought but also from liberalism, which is a modernizing, antitraditionalist movement dedicated to correcting the evils and abuses resulting from the misuse of social and political power. In The Devil\u2019s Dictionary (1906), the American writer Ambrose Bierce cynically (but not inappropriately) defined the conservative as \u201ca statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others.\u201d Conservatism must also be distinguished from the reactionary outlook, which favours the restoration of a previous, and usually outmoded, political or social order.\n\nBrittanica",

Even if we use your definition.  The commies said they were going to make everyone equal right?  How many people died to try to achieve that and how do you plan to do that without forcing people to be the same through the threat of the state? \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re answering in good faith now. \n\nYes or no. Commies are left wing? If you say they are until they act like authoritarians as you seem to be implying, I would tell you you need to rethink your definition then just ignore the last 140 years. \n\nTotalitarianism is a political system and a form of government that prohibits opposition political parties, disregards and outlaws the political claims of individual and group opposition to the state, and controls the public sphere and the private sphere of society. Therefore there is nothing there saying right wingers are this and left wingers are not. Both can fall into this trap. You\u2019re confusing the stated goals with the means to reach it. They want equality and the left has no issue killing you to make things more equal for the group using the complete force of the state with no allowed opposition. \n\nThe left killed more. Just accept it.",

Youll notice none of the definitions Ive used have anything to do with economics. Thats because economics alone dont determine your political orientation. \n\nIts not ignoring the last 140 years. Those atrocities happened, but what makes them left wing? Segregationists also \u201cpursued equality\u201d, we know that wasnt a left wing movement and was purely *bullshit*. \n\nLeft wing politics are defined by their focus on equality and egalitarianism \n\nRight wing politics are defined by their prioritization of hierarchy. They try to maintain and create inequality. \n\nUnder those definitions, its very obvious that totalitarianism isnt a left wing ideology. Its a right wing ideology. \n\nCommunism, as written by Marx and without any other political views, is a left wing ideology. \n\nTotalitarianism with a communist economic system is a blend of left and right and would need to be weighed as such. \n\nWhich part of this specifically do you disagree with?",

It\u2019s equal punishment because it is the Same punishment. \n\nSo you just believe everything someone says. If they say we want equality so different bathrooms and in every case the blacks is out back your just gonna take thier word for it lol? \n\nBeing a hypocrite doesn\u2019t prevent you from espousing those ideals lol, and if they are never kicked out your tacitly approving of them if you never speak out. \n\nThe fact that he is attracted to men lol. \n\nThe fact that they have that title and are being paid lol. Do you think the only thing firefighters ever do is fight fires? \n\nThey don\u2019t need to lol. The point is they are not mutually exclusive lol. You can have all those things and equality in the sense where everyone is equal. If no one can create a new party, everyone is equal lol. If no one can make certain claims, everyone is equal. You have one potato and two people. How are you going to make it equal if the person says no I am not sharing my potato. What if you gulag everyone with a religious beliefs, yeah that\u2019s equality lol. And yes if you ban vegetarians that is equality lol since no one can be one we all equal as meat eaters lol. \n\nYou understand equality can lead to the justified killing of people right? It just means the same for all or equal. That could be equal pain and suffering lol and will mean the lowest common denominator.",

But totalitarian isnt a left wing stance, so that moves them towards the right. Lets say, communism as an ideology with no other views rates a 7.5 out of 10 on the left side of the spectrum. Totalitarianism would have its own rating for its position on the right side of the spectrum. Maybe its a 7/10, maybe its an 8/10. In any case, it moves that person rightward from their 7.5/10 Left position. \n\nThe value is that they get paid right?

Nothing. Zero. Nada.

That is what is so dumb about this is you almost need a totalitarian government to even enforce true equality or anything close to it because dissent cannot be tolerated. And the left has made this clear with there new stance on words you can\u2019t say and ideas that are to dangerous to consider and must be banned.
