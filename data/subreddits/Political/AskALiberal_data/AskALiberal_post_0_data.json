Its sometimes called  \"History from Below\", as well as specific names for specific approaches.\n\nInstead of focusing on Franklin or Washington, this approach would focus on how economic forces encouraged thr colonists for seeking independence from Britain, or how decades of skirmishes with Native Tribes led to a focus on hit-and-run tactics early in the war, or on expectations of \"manly conduct\" during war. The focus is less on individual people overall, at any level.\n\nIf I were making a Revolutionary War movie with a \"History from below\", focus here's how I'd do it:\nJohnny is a young man in Boston. His father runs a modest shipping business that's being squeezed by British taxes. Johnny tangles with Loyalists on the streets of Boston, and ends witnessing the Boston Massacre. He is loyalty is torn because his cousin Billy is a Loyalist, but he ends up joining the Sons of Liberty. He partakes in the Boston Tea Party.\n\nWhen the war breaks out, Johnny wants to join up, but his father, a Quaker, doesn't believe war is right and this leads to a rift between them. Johnny joins up anyway and we see some failed early skirmishes until his unit is whipped into shape. The climax is Johnny fighting at Bunker Hill, showing his patriotism and bravery. The movie ends with Johnny and his comrades in arms listening to someone read out the new Declaration of Independence",

History doesn't turn on his individual actions, History turns on the actions of thousands of Johnnys, who are driven into action by complex historical forces.\n\nTo illustrate, let's imagine how the British might be portrayed in each context. A \"Great Man\" movie might have a scene of King George foaming at the mouth and vowing to crush the rebels, a la Hamilton. A \"Historical Forces\" approach might have a scene where Parliament is discussing the need to raise revenue and cut costs after the French and Indian War. One places the emphasis on George's individual actions and the other on the economic reasons for British actions. Neither is right or wrong but they're different approaches.",

I could see Gretchen Whitmer getting it tbh. \n\nThe DNC is gonna be offering \u2018unelectable\u2019 candidates incentives to stay out of the race. Bernie Sanders probably already has a big paycheck to ensure his loyalty in 2028 and 2032.",
