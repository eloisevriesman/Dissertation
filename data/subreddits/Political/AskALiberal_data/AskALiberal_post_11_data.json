            "body": "The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.\n\nI have a family friend who has become a QAnon conspiracy theorist. She recently posted a meme of an open door that something like, \"people who support an open border should celebrate on May 25 by leaving their front door open.\"\n\nI commented that nobody on the left supports open borders other than most extreme leftists. She stated that she knows several people on the left that do.\n\nSo my question is, do you or someone you know support open borders? I also asked her to name one politician in Congress that is lobbying for open borders. I'm sure she'll ignore that request. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The link directs right to the question, but it starts at 44:46 and runs through 47:30.  They both talk about recognizing the reason why people are illegals and being compassionate.  Reagan talks about working with Mexico and suggests that putting up a fence is stupid.  If I didn't know these two men were both Republican and this were done in 1980, I'd have assumed this were a debate between modern liberals.",

Most abolitionists advocate for a gradual approach that in and of itself isn't absolute and a step along the way to some form of abolition is the kind of 'retconned' defunding you mentioned.\n\nBottom line: like usual, the people criticizing the positions of the protesters didn't know what they were or what they meant and they never tried to find out because they never cared (even four years later).",

If there was a messaging issue, it was internal to the protesters, because that is what multiple protestors stated outright.\n\nAt that same time, tons of viral twitter and fb posts said things like \"Police originated to chase slaves\" and whether many (like myself) believed in redirecting funding to train mental heath services, these same protesters attacked Biden's statements who wanted to add funding for mental health first responder services but not remove funding from police.\n\nNo, not every protester or ally believed \"defund\" meant take away all the funding, including me. But a **significantly large** percentage of advocates did which is why that expression caught on, and I reject you trying to gaslight by rewriting history. I watched it happen with my own eyes and questioned advocates. I had to explain to some that the rich would hire their own private police forces, a far worse outcome.\n\nA **large percentage** I spoke with wanted money *completely* removed, to wreck the police institution, just like GOP advocates removing government money to Planned Parenthood to try to wreck them. Exactly the same sentiment, and no, I didn't misunderstand what several were saying.",

But I define open boarders as no restrictions and no immigration at all. At the most, it would be like the Canadian boarder before 911. But now at the Canadian boarder, you need to privide an ID and purpose of the visit. (So it isnt 'open' by that standard). My friends were almost turned away onetime too!  \n\nHaving Immigration enforcement take ID and perform a background check is a form of control. And likely will require records of entry and departing. Or a VISA. So that is a form of control. Even if the term \"controlled boarder\" is vast. It indicates that it isnt opened or closed (like N. Korea). \n\nI agree that my answer isnt the clearist. But im sure there is a better term or subcategory that isnt \"open\". \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_border\n\nAlso! Boarders are more than just the port of entry. You can have those roads unrestrictive. But if the laws are hostile to incomers or a population that is xenophobic, that doesnt matter. Movement inside the country will be restrictive to outsiders. Again SKorea is a great example. Even if you make it in, you will be escourted, watched, and manipulated with every step you take.",

Something like 99% of people haven't committed a crime so that's basically everyone.  Maybe people opposed to open borders are assuming we're going to stop trying to prevent terrorists from entering the country, but they're also worried that absent any restrictions immigration levels will overwhelm our ability to assimilate new arrivals.  The difference between people who are open borders and those who are not is if you think such a limit exists/should exist or not.

We don't currently have open borders and we already receive more immigrants than any other country. If we open our borders, this number would obviously increase, I really don't understand how you don't acknowledge this will happen. Currently, 50 million people in the US were born in another country and immigrated here. The next closest is Germany at 16 million. We actually outnumber the next four countries combined in the number of immigrants we currently bring in and we are having housing crisis in places such as Texas and New York where they are being brought to.

I don't know what yours is based on.\n\nHaving low population density for our size doesn't actually mean much since our population tends to revolve around metropolitan areas. We cannot just build communities in the middle of nowhere. Those resources are also not able to be distributed equally in our current system. Things such as social services are already bankrupting our nation despite our current excess in wealth. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security make up around 60% or more of our overall spending and is close to our gross income alone. My premise is based on the fact that resources such as these entitlement programs, electricity, gas, water, and housing are limited and costly. We are able to manage right now because we are keeping our population stable through limited immigration. These resources will be further strained by an increase in population in general and thus my assertion is that open borders will lead to greater numbers of immigrants which will increase our resource burden. This should have been obvious, but you are not actually responding in good faith, so whatever. \n\n>Your mild acknowledgement is contradicted by your continued use of the silly \"resources\" argument.\n\nI am sorry that you don't find utilities and housing as important to consider, but most people do. You are glossing over a very important aspect of how many people we would be able to take care of given our current systems. You can advocate for a completely different way of allocating resources in our country, that is fine, but that is not the conversation we have been having. We were discussing what would happen if we had open borders.\n\n>This doesn't actually address what I said there, maybe try again.\n\nGod I hate this kind of condescending response. If you don't think I addressed the point that point out why. Such low effort. \n\n>Well, you've given no support for this statement, so why would I just take your word for it?\n\nI would expect the support for the statement to be obvious for anyone who may have studied history, but I guess you didn't. \n\nThe first huge upticks in immigration that we saw was during the 1880s and 90s due to the Industrial Revolution and our need for greater numbers of laborers both to work in the newly developed factories as well as to help build the railroads that crossed the country. As we got into the 20th century, immigration was heavily curtailed in part because of racist ideologies specifically targeting Asia, South America, Africa, and parts of southern Europe along with economic and political ideals of isolationism that we held prior to the world wars. After WWII, the United States became the dominant power of the western hemisphere and slowly began to grow its amount of immigrants over time. This was in part due to our ability to house them thanks to our increased economic standing after the war as well as our change in foreign policy to be more accepting for both moral reasons as well as political in order to combat the spread of communism with the Soviet Union. Many of these immigrants were coming from western Europe as they were our main allies at the time. \n\nAs we get closer to the 1980s and 1990s, we grew our relations with South America in part, again, to combat the spread of communism as well as an effort to increase domestic profits through foreign production thanks to NAFTA and other trade agreements in the 90s. Since then there has been continued increases to immigration as we have continued to source cheap labor from South America in order to keep domestic production high and costs low. People continue to come to the United States with work and education being the two biggest reasons for them to do so. We turn millions of people away every year because we already let in numbers that we are able to handle. In fact, the number one cause of illegal immigration is actually legal visa holders overstaying their work or education visas and remaining in the United States anyway. These numbers would be increased by the millions of people that we would otherwise turn away that already come and this does not include the increase of people who would come if they knew there were no barriers whatsoever. \n\nThat is the historical support for my statements. Feel free to do your own research on the topic as well. \n\n>The point, that you are ignoring, is that people aren't just waiting in the wings to come to the U.S. if we opened the borders. They come either way, regardless of immigration law. Your angry little questions don't actually address that.\n\nThere are, again, millions who are turned away at the border that would otherwise be let in under open borders. I also do not believe your assertion that there aren't people waiting in other countries to emigrate to the United States since there are millions currently waiting for permission to legally come to this country. I guess those people aren't actually waiting? Or do you view them as stupid for just not coming over like other people do to be turned away? Sorry, I shouldn't ask questions you aren't going to answer. \n\n>Shouting \"you're absurd\" at your screen isn't actually an argument.\n\nCorrect. That statement was not part of my argument. I simply found your ignorance absurd.",

How will a country of our size ever handle a few million people? \n\n>Sorry, I shouldn't ask questions you aren't going to answer.\n\nYou should try asking good questions, that would be a start. That there are some people who are waiting to come to the US is not evidence that there is an unsustainable number who want to come, or that this number would linearly increase forever. You have taken a simple statement \"some people are waiting to immigrate to the US,\" and extrapolated that to mean what you want it to mean. Hopefully you can put together how foolish that is. \n\n>Correct. That statement was not part of my argument. I simply found your ignorance absurd.\n\nRight back at ya bud.",

If we have open borders then anyone could come into our country, or at the very least that is the version of open borders that I am speaking out against. If people are able to come over with no limitation then the millions of people that we currently turn away at the border plus the millions that are left in their home countries waiting for permission to enter legally would all be able to come over. This is not including the untold number of people who currently want to come to the United States but chose not to come because they knew they would be turned away, were denied visas, or otherwise did not view it as a viable possibility. I see no reason why opening the borders would NOT lead to potentially limitless population increases.\n\nHowever, that is based on current and past immigration numbers, I don't claim to be able to read the future. I would use other countries as examples, but I am not aware of any other country in the world that has open borders as a general policy so I did not have anything to compare it to.",

It would be a police checkpoint, not like a current bill-of-rights-doesn't-apply immigration checkpoint. If there's plausible cause to detain someone, they can do it, otherwise welcome to the United States. \n\n> What do you mean by apprehending criminals?

But this situation does depend on the suspected terrorist volunteering their phone or a warrant for it having been issued. \n\n> If someone crosses outside of a controlled point of entry, should we be okay with them getting in?\n\nAssuming they have broken any other aviation or maritime laws, no.

But terrorism is obviously something that [*can*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsuccessful_terrorist_plots_in_the_United_States_post-9/11) be thwarted, even when the perpetrators are inside the country, with constitutional rights.\n\nTerrorism should be viewed as actual specific plans to be detected and prevented.

During the Trump administration and towards the run up to the 2020 election, yes I knew quite a few that latched onto opposition to immigration, and were proud to admonish those opposed.  \n\nThe fact is, this is not a left vs right issue.  It\u2019s not a racial issue.  It is mostly a wealthy vs working class issue, that cuts across party lines.  Unchecked, illegal immigration benefits human traffickers, businesses and very wealthy families at the expense of the taxpayers, legal lower/middle class workers, and those who are being exploited.  \n\nI worked along side many legal and illegal foreign born workers in construction and services industries in Washington DC.  I\u2019ve been involved in many projects working within K Street law and lobbying firms.  Those firms have reception desks that cost more than the median income in the US.  They spend lavishly on architectural finishes that cost 10-100x more than your typical American home.  50% of the workers doing the interior construction and the building cleaning these buildings are here illegally.  They are in effect being underpaid by clients that could afford to pay living wages, and they are taking away jobs from potentially legal workers.  If you can train a person who does not speak English, who has never used a power tool, who was a farmer in a 3rd world country how to install steel channel studs, insulation, drywall, or paint, then you can train any unemployed inner city man or woman how to do that same job.  (Source ME, I was there)\n\nThere were democrats who thought that making opposition to immigration, a racist MAGA talking point would help them come election time.  Well that\u2019s totally backfired in a huge way.  It\u2019s certainly not going to be easy to change course before November.",
