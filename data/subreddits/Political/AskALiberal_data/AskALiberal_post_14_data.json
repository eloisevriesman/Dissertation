Which is a secondary and tertiary themed in a lot of your bluegrass classics. \n\nThere is also an interesting pass that we tend to give left leaning media in regards to making fun of rural, mountain, and farming folk. Which tends to bleed into a weird disdain for bluegrass.\n\nThis is changing thankfully with a lot of queer bluegrass folks speaking out about these inconsistencies and how problematic the views I mentioned are.",

It's amazing. \n\nPart of the reason I think I probably like bluegrass so much is that I listened to it a lot when I was little--I grew up in the DC area and we had bluegrass on public radio from 3-6 for decades, no commercials just a bunch of old Bill Monroe tunes among others...tearjerkers like Footprints in the Snow always get me.
