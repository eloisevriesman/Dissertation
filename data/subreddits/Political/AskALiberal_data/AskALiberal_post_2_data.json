As a European, I kinda want to believe Biden is going to win, but I am also extremely worried that Trump is going to. And based on the opinion polls it can go either way. So what is your view on this? Who do you think is going to win this year's U.S. Presidental Election? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In an ordinary cycle, you've got the known incumbent and then the unknown challenger who people don't know much about.  But, this time around, you've got two extremely well known candidates; everyone has an opinion on both of them.  There's no unknown quantity in the race.",

People are going to know a former VP's name, but they're not generally going to have much more than that, and there's a lot of space for a VP to chart a different course than the previous administration.\n\nTo be a credible presidential candidate in the first place you have to have fairly high name recognition; it's pretty rare for someone obscure to win a primary.  But there's still a big difference between what the mass public thinks about a former president vs. what they think about someone they've heard of but who is still defining their public stances.",

But I think it's a little different than the middle. Maybe not so much. But it seems it's one thing to be undecided about who you're going to vote for. It's another thing to decide if you love a candidate enough to bother going to vote, and another thing to decide if you hate a candidate enough to go out and vote. \n\nI don't think there's many people in the middle. I think people made up their mind about whether they were going to vote for or against Trump long ago. \n\nAnd make no mistake. They are voting against Trump or for Trump.",

The Arizona GOP had to sell their headquarters because they didn't have the money to pay the rent, and the Michigan GOP might go bankrupt because of their money trouble. That's a problem because state parties are important for elections, and the lawsuits have cost them a lot of money. The National GOP might have to bail them out, and that, combined with paying Trump's legal fees, makes it even worse.\n\nTrump also doesn't have many good allies in swing states.\nIn Pennsylvania, the Democrats have a popular Senator up for re-election and, a pretty popular governor, and another reasonably popular Senator.\nIn Michigan, they have a popular governor, two Senators, and an open senate seat with a strong candidate.\nIn Wisconsin, they have a reasonably popular governor and a very popular Senator up for re-election. The Republican Senator is pretty unpopular, and while he has won re-election, it was by a very small margin, whereas the Democrat won her last election handedly.\nNevada has two Democratic Senators, one up for re-election, with the likely GOP candidate being weaker than in the last election, where the Dems won. While the state has a republican governor, he is relatively moderate and has tried to distance himself from Trump, so he likely won't help much.\nIn Arizona, the reasonably popular governor is a Democrat, one senator is a Democrat, the other independent (elected as a dem) that caucuses with the Dems, and an open Senate race that leans Democratic given the fact the Republican is crazy and the Democrat is a relatively strong candidate. The former Republican Governor also has a bad relationship with Trump after he acknowledged Biden's victory in the state, so he won't help, abortion is also on the ballot, which might help Biden.\nIn Georgia, both senators are Democrats (both reasonably popular), and while the governor is a Republican, he has a frosty relationship with Trump for acknowledging Biden's win in the state, so he probably won't help much either.\n\nI'd say a combination of these factors will probably mean that Biden wins Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, probably Arizona, perhaps Georgia, and Nebraska's 2nd congressional district. Winning the states, I believe he will, is going to guarantee him a win. As long as he wins the Midwest states and Nebraska's 2nd congressional district, he has won the election, though just barely.",

Like how many of these Wisconsin/Michigan/Pennsylvania voters are going Trump 16, Biden 20, Trump 24? I'm sure those people are out there, but I can't imagine there's many of them.\n\n\nNotably, I think Jan 6 hurt Trump more than anyone realizes. My anecdotal evidence is my dumb-as-shit Trump supporter cousin, who proudly voted for him in 16 and 20, has said he won't vote for him in 24 because of Jan 6. He won't vote for Biden either, so he'll just stay home.\n\n\nSo break it down...\n\n\nTrump 16, Trump 20, likely goes Trump 24. This group isn't losing many voters, but Jan 6 may have made a small difference. Their alternative is going to be not voting in 24. Though I'd love to chat with a person who ends up Trump/Trump/Biden. \n\n\nHillary 16, Biden 20, likely goes Biden 24. I don't think this group loses many voters. I'd be very curious to meet a Hillary/Biden/Trump voter. Rejected Trump twice, but 3rd time's a charm? There's some Israel related blow back on Biden in this group. But this is also the group that has been either Democratic loyalists or holding their nose to fight Trump since 2016. \n\n\nTrump 16, Biden 20, likely goes Biden 24 or doesn't vote. These voters rejected Trump once already. Trump/Biden/Trump would be a very odd pattern - if you've already rejected Trump, and you also want to reject Biden, I'd imagine you don't vote. \n\n\nHillary 16, Trump 20, likely go Trump 24. I'm not sure how large this group is, but these people clearly changed their mind and thought Trump was doing a good job.\n\n\nEither 16, didn't vote 20. Those people likely don't vote again. They rejected both options in 20 and it's the same choice in 24. \n\n\nDidn't vote 16, either 20. Either stick to their choice or don't vote. If you didn't vote in 16 and voted for Trump, likely you felt he was doing a good job. If you didn't vote in 16, and voted for Biden in 20 then likely you had a concern about Trump. My guess is this is the demographic that will tell us who wins. \n\n\nDidn't vote 16 or 20, for the sake of completion, I'd guess most of this group continues to note vote.\n\n\nBiden voters weren't necessarily Biden supporters, but rather Trump haters. That's not usually a way to win an election, but Trump created a very unique set of circumstances. None of that has changed. And while the basket of deplorables are still out there and as loud and fervent as ever, I don't know that they've really grown in the last 4 years.",

However, as our general presidential election isn't fair to begin with (EC, FPTP, etc.), that changes the odds significantly.  \n\nI think Biden will still win, given that Trump hasn't yet won a popular vote, and managed to lose the second election and even caused others to lose in 2022.  I can't fathom how he could've possibly *gained* any new support, but then again, another anomaly was that in 2020, he managed to *gain* support after 4 years of insanity.  It's so hard to process how stupid and forgetful people are in this country.  \n\nThat being said, since he's also on trial and there are at least *some* people who have realized from this trial - the supposedly weakest one - that he pulled one over people's eyes in 2016, there's hope that people are done with the \"baggage\" as they had also said in 2022 after getting shellacked and there being no \"red wave\" then, in much part, on his behalf.  \n\nThe caveat is, he already tried to steal an election, and the fucked up thing is, every single major player who participated in that scheme (minus Navarro) is still free as a bird, and able to engage in more fuckery, with the mistakes of the past registered to learn from.  The more sensible ones will stay away from it, knowing Trump is at the front end of it again (\"Mierdas touch\"), but we've learned from history that hasn't stopped anyone from trying to use him for money or power or fame, anyway.  \n\nSo I expect fuckery, especially if he loses, but I think he will try some new scheme we haven't thought of, since no one saw \"fake electors\" nor an actual violent insurrection in 2020 as a possibility.  Apart from all of this, Biden wins.  Best case scenario, Trump gets sentenced for this trial immediately and has to wait in jail for his appeal, while he gets shut down by the Supreme Court for immunity, and the DC and FL cases move on, one or both completing before the election anyway, exposing more of his shenanigans.",

[270towin.com](http://270towin.com) is a website whose intention is to aggregate polls and show how things currently look.  The hope for sites like this is that by examining a bunch of different polls instead of just one, you're more likely to remove bias that single polls might have.\n\nHere is a map that shows what the election looks like if you apply current-day polling onto a map with the Electoral College.   \n[https://www.270towin.com/maps/biden-trump-2024-map-based-on-pollscurrent-day](https://www.270towin.com/maps/biden-trump-2024-map-based-on-pollscurrent-day)\n\nHere is a bunch of different information on the forecast for 2024 if you want to see that too.   \n[https://www.270towin.com/2024-presidential-election-forecast-predictions/](https://www.270towin.com/2024-presidential-election-forecast-predictions/)\n\nthe TLDR; that likely won't be popular here is that Trump is currently ahead.  Note though that's just based on current polling data and there's a lot of time till November.  We haven't gotten into the real intense election push just yet where things can change wildly.  So even if Trump is ahead at the moment, everything should be taken with a grain of salt.  There's a lot of time before the elections and a lot can happen in the coming months to shake things up.",
