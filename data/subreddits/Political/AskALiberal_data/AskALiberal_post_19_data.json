Lots of people I know used to be more on the extremes in their early 20s. I was a right libertarian and had a lot of libertarian friends along with a few socialists. I'm still in touch with most of them and they are all pretty mainstream democrats or Never Trump Republicans. The two exception are people that have completely dropped off our social circles.\n\nTalking to people between roughly 35 - 65, that seems to be a common experience.\n\nI don't think it's to be unexpected. Those earlier years are when people are thinking about and playing with their identities the most.\n\nThere is a phenomenon where people that are very far right or far left will change their ideology but completely reverse to another extreme.",

I was a neoliberal when I was younger. \n\nIt all fundamentally and seriously changed when we got in college. \n\nMy friend saw the marxists there and - I'll use his phrasing - \"what kind of people they associate themselves with\". He basically turned, to say it once more in his words, an \"anti-woke\" Marxist. When we met with each other and spoke about politics, I always pointed at the contradictio in terminis and now he's slowly moving toward the centre-left. \n\nI, myself, pulled more toward the rightwing. I was originally a neoliberal but slowly evolved, by becoming more and more aware of certain fields, to the rightwing. I'll be the first to admit I flirted with the radical right. Was it truly my opinion? No. Was it me trying to shock others? You may bet your ass. I become more moderate when I entered college, having to discuss what I think and people that would question what I said. It was a rough/rude awakening, but necessary. \n\nIt firmly dragged me from populism and radicalism, and toward what I am now: a conservative. I would place myself between the centre-right and rightwing, but I have rejected 1) populism and 2) radicalism. \n\n My other friends went the same route as me: They went from neoliberalism to conservatism in varying degrees. The radical right never gained as much ground with them, as they weren't exploring politics as much as I did.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nBased upon my experiences, most younger people will become more radical and they're much, much more prone to fall for revolutionary, radical rhetorics. After a few years, when they've seen enough of the world and when they've had to actively debate their positions, they moderate and it  ends in either centre-left to leftwing or centre-right to rightwing.",

I think all businesses should have some form of constitution that allows employees to have some decision making power, some ownership powers, and share in both profits and losses.
