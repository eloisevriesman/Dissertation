On top of that they disproportionately volunteer for military services and are subject to the same degrees of disability from that. On top of the general disability and hardship that come from physically demanding jobs. Which dominate rural spaces. The idea every rural person is a evangelical Christian is as laughable as the idea that every Californian is a socialist.\n\n>So how do we de-centralize social safety net services to help rural America without screwing over all the other people\n\nSimple. Allocated equal funding to rural hospitals. You could even do a hybrid model of hospitals getting a baseline regardless of location and then an additional amount on a per patient in their service area (rounded to the nearest 5,000) basis. Which could reopen all of the rural hospitals that are getting closed. Or at the very least reopen wings and units that have either been shuttered or criminally understaffed. That way we don't have people traveling 5 hours to deliver a baby in a maternity ward, or see about their heart attack, or have a broken bone reset, or even in some cases get basic physicals and care.\n\nIn that same vain utilize already existing public structures that can be supplemented with mobile treatment options. Run clinics out of high schools on the weekends. Hell even if you had a rotation that a bus with nurses, doctors, an X ray machine and maybe even an MRI machine set up in a high school gym one Saturday in a two month cycle you could cover the entire population without any real additional infrastructure. You could even have school bus drivers pick up people and bring them to that location since those routes and areas are already pretty well planned out.\n\nYou could even raise additional money for it by combining Medicaid and Medicare (as well as potentially aspects of the VA, but that's a much more complicated process) and eliminate all of their administrative bloat and hire more doctors, nurses, and technicians. Or even just sell any of the number of minor tax increases to rural folks because for once we have a very clear example of what their money is going towards not just a clinic 5 hours away that is by all practical means inaccessible.\n\nIt's not that difficult to actually address rural folks' issues.",

Many earlier Americans and immigrants intended to come here and work their asses off, and many of them did found success. More and more younger folks today are seeing the European model and going like hey, maybe not everyone likes the rat race and furthermore, that system treats folks who aren't able to work or work as much with more dignity, so that leads to a preference for more social democratic ideals in younger people. In turn, that leads to a lot of misgivings about the US. For the record, I think its possible to keep America to its more traditional boot straps ideals, but still treat its marginalize better. You don't need to tax like the Scandinavian to have decent basic healthcare. The bureaucratic bloat just has to be streamlined a ton.",

Your experiences are your own and they affect you and how you see the world, you have to understand that's the same for other people too.\n\nOne thing I think is noteworthy with most Americans is that they find it super annoying and not at all useful when someone they didn't ask starts telling them \"I've been through way more than you, life is way harder for me, so all your problems are dumb and stupid and don't matter. You didn't go through what I went through so you have no right to complain.\"\n\nNo one fuckin asked you, and your only argument is \"I've had it worse. I've had it worse.\" Well fuck me then I guess all my problems aren't really problems. You want me to bow down and thank you on my knees for helping me see that all my issues are really just because I'm a dumb weak whiny complainer?? You want me to nod solemnly with tears streaming down my face and vow to be a better man who appreciates his life from here on out?? What the hell do you even think you're accomplishing by telling people their life isn't that bad?\n\nI get it you volunteer and work with underpriveledged kids convincing them their lives could be better. That's amazing and great, it makes you a good person, but being a good person doesn't give you the right to tell everyone you see that they should shut the fuck up and love it. It's obvious from the tone of your posts that you're exasperated with people around you not \"appreciating America enough.\" Not everyone needs you to tell them how much they should appreciate their own world. Not everyone's issues can just be swept under the rug with a wave of the \"I've had it worse\" wand. Not everyone needs to be told by you that they're fuckin doing it wrong. Help those in need--your students and those you volunteer for--and leave the rest of us to figure out our own shit.\n\nHell try being sympathetic and see what you learn about peoples' hardships. Rather than constantly comparing them to your own. I get it you had a shit life. Well people can have a not-as-shit life as you had and it still be pretty shit. Yeah you're saying \"oh I said not in every case\" you also said you're sick and tired of seeing people not take responsibility so to me it sounds like you have a complex. Maybe you think the people here don't deserve to be here because they don't appreciate it like you think they should.\n\nPeople don't need your approval of their problems for them to be \"real problems\". And we don't need you telling us how we should feel about where we live. I respect your opinion but we had a reasonable discourse on it already and all I get is the same refrain of \"but people aren't....\" I'm done hearing the same thing over and over. Look up \"high horse\" and get the fuck down off yours boss",

And I've heard many people who grew up in really bad neighborhoods, say they went into the Marines or Peace Corps or something and didn't realize how bad it was in other countries.\n\nBut you do have to understand the nuances of where we are as a country in American history. There's a growing sense that while people are struggling the systems that are supposed to be put in place to support them are being intentionally sabotaged in order to basically get out of having to provide those services. It's gotten way harder to keep food stamps for example. Or applying for and continuing on Section 8 is such a big hassle. \n\nBasically the idea is that we live in such a prosperous and powerful country that no one here should have to struggle. This preoccupation with trying to force everyone to \"earn their right to live\" comes across more and more as a disingenuous mode of thought designed to prevent a growing section of Americans from reaching true prosperity. There's a sore spot with people in being told that you'll make it if you just try harder.\n\nSome people have medical bills they can't afford and so they can't work. Basic medical shouldn't be so incredibly expensive. Basic childcare is so expensive it's not worth it to work because you almost have to pay a whole wage just to afford someone watching your kid.\n\nThe thing is not everyone can have the high paying job. It's more and more competitive and you have to be extra special and more extra special. Where is security for those who work hard, work two jobs and raise kids, but aren't super talented or social or especially intelligent? The \"earn your keep\" thought process is designed to discount those disadvantages. The \"I had it worse\" card is also designed to preclude empathy in favor of practicality. Because you did something doesn't mean someone else can do it and that in turn doesn't mean someone else shouldn't get the same access to happiness that you have. \n\nFor that mode of thought has allowed greedy politicians and the like to justify gutting or neglecting necessary services like disability, social security, Medicare, etc. the idea being that if we make necessities too accessible, people won't just force themselves to work harder to earn the same quality of life",

They don't get an official say in government but they'll usually get some favourable funding considerations.\n\nA recent example of that was 2017-2019, when the Conservative party was 9 seats short of a majority and they made an agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (a hard right, religious oriented Northern Irish party) who had won 10 seats. The last time that sort of arrangement happened was in 1977, and that was the first time since WW2.\n\nYou're much better off looking at countries like Germany or Belgium if you want an electoral system that leads to coalitions.

Liberal monarchies wouldn't need to rely on repression to the degree democratic-minded people seem to suggest. They would mostly rely on good long-term policies. The incentive is clear. Good long-term policies ensure a good economy and thus happy people who won't feel the need to rebel against the crown.\n\nAlso, in democracies, political leaders rarely get the support of the people. It's usually the biggest minority ruling over others. Actually, more often than not, non-voters are the biggest chunk of the population.\n\nAnd it's not like people nowadays don't feel repressed in democracies. For example, the sentiment against mainstream media is mostly the feeling of being repressed by liberally-minded democrats (not meaning the US party).\n\n>A democratic leader goes through an approval process\n\nThe approval doesn't equal quality statecraft.\n\nTrump is an example. There are plenty of incompetent political leaders in democracies, at rates that one might easily lose faith in humanity (and democracy).\n\nAnd that a politician is in power for 8-10 years doesn't mean they became good at statecraft. Monarch being educated in that makes it much more probable.",

There is simply no longer an incentive to have any kids at all. The costs of raising kids are individual, the benefits of having them are nationalized. The costs of not having kids are also widely nationalized. If you don't have kids, you also don't have to worry about your inheritance. You can just blow out all of your earnings towards the end of your life and then have the government step in to pay for your assisted living, if the need arises. My parents had to bear those costs for their parents AND have to worry about what they're leaving for me and my sister.\n\n  \nThe fact that nobody questions this system is wild to me. It borders insanity and destroys my faith in democracy.\n\n \n\nAverage life expectancy has also risen drastically. Over here in Germany we spend an annual 1.1 trillion Euros in social spending, two thirds of which are just retirees, strongly disproportional health care costs, retirement and state pensions. That's about 700-800 billion annually. This is the same amount the US spends for its entire armed forces, discretionary spending and otherwise. Germany's boomers cost as much as the entire US military. (Our economy is a sixth of yours) \n\nLet that sink in. \n\n  \nAnd I do think the boomers really feel they are entitled to endless wealth and growth, without bearing any of the burdens, be that in raising children or paying taxes.\n\nMy cousin's neighbor is a boomer engineer who constantly complains about how lazy Gen Z is and asks who's gonna pay for his retirement. Guess how many kids this fucker has. Exactly: Zero. Doesn't like immigration either and he has a very high standard of living. If you bring any of this up with a boomer, even those who did have two kids, they usually get extremely defensive and start deflecting.\n\nPeople like that engineer must get fucked hard and get a reality check, asap.\n\nUnfortunately, it is a vicious cycle, like you mentioned. If we can't break out of this downward spiral I really fear that we are fucked. As costs increase further and further, the boomers are also going to dig in their heels more and more and the can will get kicked down the road into perpetuity.",

Heck, I remember 20 years ago how older people were telling us children that we won't enjoy the retirement and we stupidly laughed it off.\n\nAnd old people feel entitled because they paid tons of money to their older generations, while it was and still is constantly framed they themselves are saving for the retirement. Obviously, they expect the same from younger generations. That they will happily hop in to participate in a hugely disadvantegeous system.",

Because otherwise local and State governments will (despite your personal assurances that you don\u2019t want an gunless society) make it such that it\u2019s impossible for people to own guns for self defense. It\u2019s like asking the question - why does / did abortion or LGBTQ, etc need to be protected as part of the Bill of Rights? Because otherwise States can effectively ban it. \n\n\nTake for example New York. Just 10 years ago it was impossible for the average person to have a gun (any gun) for self defense even at home or within their place of business. You had cases where people had been robbed and attacked and injured multiple times at their business or in their home and New York still denied them gun permits. It was effectively a ban. Meanwhile the governor could have a gun for self defense. His body guards could have guns for self defense. So could the mayor. So did Trump have a gun also. Without it being a right - you get classism. \n\n\nIt was only after Heller and Bruen cases that the Federal Courts determined that New York was actually trampling on the rights of the common person in being able to own a gun for self defense - that New York was forced to allow such. \n\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it. Read it from the largest association of New York black / minority public defenders:\n\n\nhttps://www.bronxdefenders.org/supreme-court-strikes-down-the-carry-provision-of-new-york-states-gun-licensing-scheme/\n\n\nThings that are not rights lead to classism and discrimination. \n\n\nBut also that doesn\u2019t mean that rights are unlimited. The first amendment isn\u2019t unlimited. You can\u2019t just threaten someone with no consequence. Same for guns. We already have gun laws in place today from background checks, to age limits, to licensing requirements, to business trade stipulations, to carry stipulations and to use stipulations.",

Although Redstone was allegedly liberal, he made news before the 2004 election, when telling his peers that he would endorse President Bush. \n\nAfter the election, the FCC attempted to change regulations without giving the required public notice. Redstone had lobbied for this change in the hope that it wouldn't be necessary to spin off CBS. But news of the regulation changes spread online and both sides of the aisle were angry about it. This was effective because the FCC backed down and Viacom was forced to spin off CBS. \n\nUnfortunately, the FCC later did change the rules (I think while Trump was President) and they did it without a whimper, this time. Viacom immediately rolled CBS back under it's wing afterwards.\n\nRegardless of whether the story that got Rather fired was true or false, I think Redstone made a deal for it to happen, in a failed attempt to save Viacom from splitting. And it would have worked had news of the changes not leaked, causing an uproar from both sides. I watched C-SPAN the morning after the news broke and people were extremely angry about it. Now ask yourself who would benefit from Rather's story being labeled as untrue, which would cost him his job at CBS?",

But I try to recognize that, on a very fundamental level, most of the people I disagree with politically in my life are decent people who are willing to stick their necks out for others. The main takeaway being that you can still take valuable lessons and ideas from ideologies you vehemently disagree with. \n\nFor example, I am not and never will be a Nazi sympathizer, but I try to recognize that the Nazis took root and were successful because there were factors at play that made many Germans feel supporting Hitler was the way to a better and happier world at the time, or at least a better and happier Germany. Flawed af logic, morals and means, but on some level you have to remind yourself that people believe things because of other things they had no control over influencing their psychology, just like you! So you shouldn't necessarily agree with them, but you shouldn't mindlessly hate and disregard them either. \n\nTL;DR be civil with people you disagree with politically, because even if they're very misguided or angry that likely originated from a place of wanting to improve something they felt was unfair/still do feel is unfair.

We've worked out frameworks on how to do some of them responsibly- i.e in specific amounts, at certain places, without doing anything that could create a danger to other people, but some of them are just too unpredictable to ever do that. Consider fentanyl- how would we regulate that? How can we even experiment with it to find out more without risking subjects getting addicted or dying outright? And for whose benefit would it all be for? \n\nAnd for drugs that are not quite as extreme, legalization would ultimately lead to commercialization and wider usage. If the intent is to keep cartels and other nefarious actors from being the profiteers, this *needs* to happen, and I would counter that having legal corporations being the dealers isn't that much better.

In fact, I had a friend whom I personally begged to not get into smoking tobacco, who was 'smart' by all accounts, but insisted she knew herself well enough that she could manage any addiction. She couldn't and is now addicted to meth and who knows what else. \n\nSuppose all that stuff becomes legal tomorrow- would you go to your pharmacy and buy some ice?

Fear tactics are not conducive to making an informed decision. It\u2019s slightly better now, but it\u2019s still primarily geared at scaring people out of trying drugs instead of allowing them to make an informed decision. \n\nAnd for a lot of people, it **is** based in reason because they\u2019re trying to escape the reality that they live in and the bit of reprieve they get while high makes an otherwise painful existence tolerable!\n\nTake, for example, smoking. Those are fact driven campaigns to inform people about potential side effects of smoking and tobacco use, and smoking rates are the lowest they\u2019ve been in history!\n\nAlong with legalization, taxes would (and should) be used for mental health and addiction services as well as Safe Consumption Sites.\n\nLastly, most people move on to \u201chigher grade stuff\u201d because of tainted supply, not because they want to. Yes, tolerance is a thing, but it can be mitigated by making sure folks using heroin are using heroin rather than heroin cut with fentanyl, ultimately leading them to fentanyl altogether.\n\nOh, also, Big Tobacco deceiving consumers was a regulatory issue, but they fixed the regulations and you no longer see that as prevalently, and certain types of advertising is banned altogether.\n\nAll of this comes from both my time working in drug policy *and* my personal struggles with addiction and recovery.\n\nI personally don\u2019t believe using drugs should be a death sentence.

The Russians wanted to vote in Gennady Zyuganov and a social democratic system similar to Austria or Sweden (which was literally his campaign promise), while the Neoliberals decided to support Boris Yeltsin and even did a whole Times Magazine spread about interfering in the election and helping him win even though was hated more than Stalin by Russians, which is a literal quote in the article.  His American advisors were even asked to tell him to call off the election if he was going to lose, which is another quote in the article. \n\nThe belief among Russians is that Yeltsin didn't even win the election and the results were faked. It's a bit misleading to not mention the whole blatant interference in the 1996 elections and why they gave up on democracy. For example, when\u00a0Pompeo says 'We lied, we cheated, we stole' he means in Bolivia where they sponsored a coup against Evo Morales... in Bolivia.\n\nThis is hardly democracy. Advertising it as Russians have to live in Yeltsin's oligarchic hell of a Russia forever is not a serious attempt.
