He\u2019s doing it on purpose.\n\nWhen someone on the right, believes his argument is valid and repeats it, you can\u2019t always assume bad face. Most of the time you shouldn\u2019t assume bad faith because they legitimately believe what they\u2019re saying.

They're largely parroting talking points and haven't thought them through. Which, I get it, that's the point. Point out that teenagers and young adults don't have fully thought out opinions. \n\nBut in this instance, the (Jewish) student asked if the Jewish community still bears the scars of the Holocaust. Shapiro agreed that it does. The student asked if the Holocaust and its legacy informed the Jewish community on how to interact with the world at large. Shapiro agreed that it did.\n\n The student then asked if the black American community still bears the scars of segregation, which ended twenty years after the Holocaust. Shapiro gave a dumbfounded \"well, uh\u2026\" The student pressed with \"wouldn't it stand to reason that the legacy of segregation would continue to affect the black community like the legacy of the Holocaust affects ours when segregation ended twenty years later and lasted twenty times longer?\" Shapiro had no answer and moved on to the next question, giving a noncommittal \"I'll have to think about that, thank you for your question.\"\n\nThat was in 2013. Eleven years on, I have yet to hear him circle back to that. But he sure as hell continues to suggest that the black community should buck up and move on. \n\nThat, to me, is lying by omission. He pretends that he cannot understand how another group's history affects its present; but that he can when the group is his own in-group.\n\nIt's at bare minimum disingenuous \u2014 in other words, arguing in bad faith.",

                            "body": "So an example of this was a more recent one.  Now Ben Shapiro really only actually engages in debates with college kids because they are easy prey to him and he can usually spout a few stats he has memorized that roughly apply to the situation, the college kid doesn't know any stats by heart, and Ben gets to pretend he's smart.  \n\n(it actually funnily goes back to the American Nazi party and how they started giving talks on college campuses because it was the only place that \"Free speech\" was still present and most other places refused to hold them.  Ironic how that works huh?)\n\nBut!  Kid stands up and asks Ben about his feelings about gay marriage.  Ben explains that gay marriage isn't right because a gay couple can't conceive a child and that's the point of marriage.  That's Ben's usual \"Gotcha!\" answer because he always ends it there with a simple biology fact and gets to be smug.  This time the kid asks Ben the follow up of will he get a divorce when Ben's kids grow up and move out, since his job as a parent is effectively done at that point.  It stunlocked Ben and he moved on to the next question.  \n\nNow ironically, because this is the kind of person Ben is, he since had an individual 1 on 1 (Months later when he had time to stew on the question), he had another kid ask the exact same question, and he could answer about how the parental relationship goes on past the kid leaving and therefore it's acceptable to stay married because he's still a parent even if the kid doesn't live at home.\n\nThat's Ben's style.  He knows his stats and gotcha answers to the \"Common\" questions, if he gets caught out, he moves on so he can't possibly be wrong, then goes back later to film a video about how he now knows how to continue to prove his point and puts it up so that when you google it, you find his nice clean version and not the original.",

His smug answer that gay couples can't have children isn't even correct, it's at a smaller rate of course but a significant number of them do have children (and 68% of such couples with children are raising a biological child), and it's clear that gay marriage leads to more children being raised, so if his concern is about creating children then he should support gay marriage.",

What I am saying is that I know *you know* better but because people are dumb or non-experts you think you can get away with it. I am talking like a Jordan Peterson or a Joseph Lapado. They don't get to use the ignorance defense, so if they say something that I am well aware has no basis in their field of research (Peterson's big one lately is hypergamy - he really doesn't like women and Lapado is everything about vaccines) then they are automatically arguing in bad faith. They are taking advantage of the fact most people don't know. Most people don't know that hypergamy is not based in any real science. Most people would think a 'turbo' cancer (it doesn't) exists if a doctor says it. \n\nI haven't had a lot of conversations with conservatives where I really thought they were arguing in bad faith, 99.99999% of the time was ignorance. They are/were convinced something was true because their media echo-chamber pushes it on them, that isn't bad faith, it is being ignorant. My MILs big one (and she is more *boomer* than *conservative*) is that everyone is getting away with crime scott free.

A good faith argument could, for example, be one that I'm willing to give up if confronted with a counterargument I can't refute. Or I could, while expressing my opinion, be engaged in a good faith endeavor of simply trying to understand where my interlocutor is coming from.\n\nWhen I argue because I'm emotionally attached to some idea and there's nothing that can be said to dispossess me of that ideology, that's not arguing in good faith. That's rather preaching something I see as being indisputable.\n\nWhen I misrepresent my beliefs as a means of proving them, this is also a way of arguing in bad faith. You see this in racist concern trolling all the time (example below).\n\nWhen I instead approach discourse honestly, as a means of testing my beliefs, and I'm open to having my mind changed, or at least conceding to a point I cannot refute, that is arguing in good faith.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n***1. Not entered into in the understanding of personal fallibility:***\u00a0\"Vaccines are wrong because they don't make sense to me. I don't care what you say.\"\n\n***2. When it's misrepresented:***\u00a0\"I'm the furthest thing in the world from a racist. I just want to help\u00a0*\\[maligned group\\].*\u00a0Maybe they're poor because they're stupid. This means their parents should not all be out doing illegal stuff but at home educating the kids. But the idea that racism exists is just\u00a0*\\[maligned group\\]*\u00a0trying to play the race card to get ahead. I mean I really care about people-- you can ask anyone in my klan-- but I'm sick of hearing about\u00a0*\\[maligned group\\]*\u00a0thinking they have it so bad. What about\u00a0*\\[privileged group\\]?*\u00a0We're not all rich and we don't get in any trouble because \\[we're basically intrinsically better\\].\"\n\n***3. Arguing from ideology:***\u00a0\"I just wanna know why you non-believers are so intent on going to hell; I don't wanna get into religion, you don't understand any of that anyway, I just wanna know why you love hell so much.\"\n\nAs for how we can know-- while sometimes it's pretty obvious-- we admittedly can't always know at first. But, engaging with people, we can know very quickly whether they approach discourse in good faith. Can they, for example concede a point? Can they refute a point without anger or personal attacks? These are dead giveaways as to who you're arguing with. For me, the first personal insult and I'm out. This person can't concede a point; they can't even hide their disdain for me disagreeing with them.",

Thats bad faith\n\nconversely when pro-choice people say that pro-lifers just want to control womens bodies... they know that isn't the case, they know thats not the pro-life position",

You might really believe you're right, but if the person you're arguing with presents evidence to the contrary and you don't even pretend to evaluate it and you just carry on with what you said before, that's bad faith.

Also just being interested in winning above actually coming to an understanding.\n\nAn example of a bad faith argument would be:\n\nCommenter: Here\u2019s a handful of different examples from different states that implemented voter ID laws only for said laws to be struck down as unconstitutional, or to otherwise have ended up only serving to disenfranchise the vote from certain demographics\n\nBad faith commenter: it\u2019s racist to assume people are too stupid to get an ID.\n\nBad faith, to me, is also people who are able to think critically about something but who deliberately don\u2019t or won\u2019t about the argument they\u2019re trying to prosecute because it would make the argument fall apart. Such examples would be things like: \u2018Bill Clinton is a pedophile because he was friends with Epstein but Trump isn\u2019t a pedophile despite also being friends with Epstein\u2019 or \u2018Joe Biden is a criminal despite no, or specious, evidence but Trump\u2019s documented crimes that have plenty of evidence behind them and that he has no real defense for are not crimes because there\u2019s no specific victim\u2019\n\nThe reason conservatives often argue in bad faith is that modern conservatism is built on fear and so is by definition bad faith. \n\nLiberals can still, obviously, argue in bad faith. It\u2019s just that \u2018we must have guns because freedom\u2019 or \u2018the real racism is against white people\u2019 and plenty of the other dominant lines in conservative circles are built on bad faith.",
