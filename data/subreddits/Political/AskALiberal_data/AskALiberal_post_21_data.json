            "body": "The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.\n\nI was just wondering what kind of vision liberal voters had for universal healthcare in the US. More specifically how broad would coverage be, and what medical procedures/medicine might not be covered? Would it just follow similar guidelines as current private healthcare coverage or would it cover all medical care one might have, regardless of \u201cnecessity\u201d. \n\nJust to give examples: \n\nOzempic- Currently most private insurance companies only cover the medicine if it is prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It is (typically) not covered when prescribed off label as a weight loss drug. Would a universal healthcare system cover the cost of such a drug?\n\nCosmetic surgeries - insurance companies cover plastic surgeries when it is required due to illness or an accident. Ie. If a breast cancer patient has a mastectomy, insurance will cover the cost of breast implants. Meanwhile elective plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons is almost always paid for out of pocket. Would this remain the case under universal insurance?\n\nAlso what about gender affirming care? I know currently most insurance covers trans related healthcare, but this often requires a gender dysphoria diagnosis/letter of recommendation from a doctor. But how do it apply to cis individuals? I saw a Reddit post once talking about how balding is an example of gender dysphoria in cis individuals, I actually really liked the comparison and found it informative, but would something like hair implants be covered for cis individuals? Would they only be covered for women due to societal standards? \n\nI am genuinely curious how universal healthcare would decide what is and isn\u2019t covered, because while I think it\u2019s a more reasonable to fear limited coverage, on the other hand too broad of coverage seems susceptible to abuse and overspending.  \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "[Medicare guidelines](https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cosmetic-surgery) are pretty reasonable: cover ozempic for diabetes, not weight loss. Doesn\u2019t cover cosmetic surgery unless you need it because of an accidental injury to improve the function of a malformed body part, or due to a mastectomy. Covers gender affirmation procedures when they're deemed medically necessary. Seems fine.",

I think an efficient universal healthcare system also needs to invest in people's health, and require they pay for their unhealthy, but that's more alcohol/sugar/fat taxes\n\n>Cosmetic surgeries - insurance companies cover plastic surgeries when it is required due to illness or an accident. Ie. If a breast cancer patient has a mastectomy, insurance will cover the cost of breast implants. Meanwhile elective plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons is almost always paid for out of pocket. Would this remain the case under universal insurance?\n\nDepends on if they have diagnosable body dysmorphia because of it, and the GP, psychiatrist, and plastic surgeon all agree that surgery is the best way to resolve this, rather than therapy\n\n>Also what about gender affirming care? I know currently most insurance covers trans related healthcare, but this often requires a gender dysphoria diagnosis/letter of recommendation from a doctor. But how do it apply to cis individuals? I saw a Reddit post once talking about how balding is an example of gender dysphoria in cis individuals, I actually really liked the comparison and found it informative, but would something like hair implants be covered for cis individuals? Would they only be covered for women due to societal standards? \n\nGender dysphoria is the distress from the body/mind mismatch. If its causing diagnosable distress, they can perform those procedures for whoever\n\n>am genuinely curious how universal healthcare would decide what is and isn\u2019t covered\n\nUsually the governing body for the state healthcare/insurance plan (depending on the model) approves specific procedures for specific illnesses, and often specific medications by brand name. In my ideal case, we use the ICD-10 and the DSM-5 for what constitutes a condition, figure out what it should cost on average to fix or manage it, then pay them that and let the doctors sort out what a patient needs",

There is a lot of waste in our system simply because pharmaceutical companies will slightly jigger or even just repackage drugs in order to fight off, generics or make themselves still be the choice.

            "body": "I am in favor of universal healthcare covering medically necessary treatments that bring a person back to their normal status/health. \n\nTo address your examples:\n\n>Ozempic- Currently most private insurance companies only cover the medicine if it is prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It is (typically) not covered when prescribed off label as a weight loss drug. Would a universal healthcare system cover the cost of such a drug?\n\nI would be in favor of continuing to handle it this way\n\n>Cosmetic surgeries - insurance companies cover plastic surgeries when it is required due to illness or an accident. Ie. If a breast cancer patient has a mastectomy, insurance will cover the cost of breast implants. Meanwhile elective plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons is almost always paid for out of pocket. Would this remain the case under universal insurance?\n\nSame. If you have an accident or illness that causes disfigurement, i am ok with universal healthcare covering plastic surgery to get you looking close to your former self. Consider it preventative mental health care. \n\n>Also what about gender affirming care? I know currently most insurance covers trans related healthcare, but this often requires a gender dysphoria diagnosis/letter of recommendation from a doctor. But how do it apply to cis individuals? \n\nWhy would gender affirming care this need to apply to CIS individuals?  Not everyone needs every type of healthcare. \n\n>I saw a Reddit post once talking about how balding is an example of gender dysphoria in cis individuals, I actually really liked the comparison and found it informative, but would something like hair implants be covered for cis individuals? Would they only be covered for women due to societal standards? \n\nCalling it gender dysphoria is nonsense. For men, male pattern baldness is just a genetic thing that happens pretty commonly. You are not entitled to have hair on your head. Its a bit worse for women, since its less common. But either way, it is generally a purely cosmetic issue, so i dont think it should be covered.",

            "body": "This is a very relevant topic of discussion, one that can only be had if we agree to keep our sneering moralizations to ourselves. Take, for example, Ozembic, which you errantly described as being prescribed off label. It isn't, it is approved for weight loss, or at least the active ingredient (semaglutide) is. The question is why was this example included? You are talking about the exact same medicine which treats the result of obesity, type II diabetes, and can treat the underlying condition (obesity). So we moralize the treatment of obesity but not diabetes? What kind of sense does that make? I know why, but I am just pointing out how these discussions can devolve - you make a moral judgement about fat people when you talk about treating obesity with a drug. It isn't a scientific or medical judgement.",

Of course the law is unlikely to pass without modification, and coverage is likely to be reduced. Personally I would be surprised if any plan wasn't at least as comprehensive as current Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThere will certainly be disagreements over what is and isn't covered, and I have no idea what those resolutions will be, but it's not like we don't already have such issues. Private insurance, with a bean counter with no medical background making decisions, deny one claim out of six to improve the bottom line. Or worse, use an AI with a 90% error rate in claim rejections because it's even cheaper.",
