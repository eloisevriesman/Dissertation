This 'iron fist' strategy has a 32% success rate as opposed to the 'Clear, Hold, Build' strategy which the author states has a 73% success rate based on research from Rand for whatever that is worth",

Correct?\n\nDepends on their role in the IDF. I imagine some are war criminals themselves independent of the charges levied at the leadership as are militants on the Palestinian side. \n\nI looked for the details on the requested indictment and [this statement](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-kc-applications-arrest-warrants-situation-state) was the best I found. It didn't seem to differentiate between Netanyahu and Gallant in terms of responsibility for charges, so I'm assuming they're charging both people with all the crimes listed but I could be missing something there. \n\nI think being insulted by the leader of a country being accused of war crimes is understandable but something, if true, the people will have to come to terms with. Depending on the circumstances it could be impossible for the trigger-puller to have sufficient context to know what they're participating is a war crime. \n\nIt's not a personal moral failing that a random Wehrmacht rifleman who believed his officer when they said they were invading Poland after Polish intrusions into Germany. I think that's a good reason to not generally prosecute such people, and i don't think that's happening. If your unshakable reaction to a leader you served under being accused of war crimes is to deny it I would in that case call it a personal moral failing",

How could we argue that the ICC's rulings are to be taken seriously if we are questiong them as soon as they are looking into the conduct of any western leaders.\n\n Those rules either apply to everyone or they don't.

They're too heavily invested, emotionally, in the infallibility of the Israeli state.  Israel has been, through pervasive propaganda, been thoroughly intertwined with Jewish identity in the US especially. \n\nYou can see it in their rhetorical strategies, like \"dozens of Arab states, only one Jewish state\" like there's supposed to be some kind of special dispensation where Israel isn't expected to act like a civilized country because it's the only Jewish-majority country in the world. \n\nYou'll see it in the way they say \"The Palestinians have been offered a state and they have refused\" even though it's a categorical lie. The Palestinians signed the Oslo Agreements, which were intended on the creation of a Palestinian-administrated state and an Israeli withdrawal to approximately the 1967 borders.  Israel broke that treaty in less than 4 years during Netanyahu's first term of office.  Every \"peace talks\" since Oslo, Israel has demanded that the Palestinians surrender at least 10% *more* of the West Bank, including when they tried to trade a toxic waste dump in the Negev desert for West Bank farmland, lol. \n\nBut you also have to realize that it's not their fault entirely either.  For as much as non-Jewish Americans have long been taught the \"Israel good, Palestinians Bad\" version of Middle Eastern Mythology through manipulation of media and history textbooks by Israeli lobbyists, it's ten times more through in Hebrew School and Israel. They've been taught false versions of history their entire lives.  You'll get about as accurate a picture of history from them as you would going down to a Trump rally in the Deep South and asking somebody with a red hat to explain the history of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. You have to deliberately go to great effort to learn the true history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and most of them aren't even aware that there would be a reason to. \n\nI mean, you'll still have people like him pretending that Israel didn't start the 1967 war, claiming it was provoked by a temporary blockade of the Strait of Tiran, even though that blockade was provoked by the unprovoked IDF massacre of Jordanian troops at As Samu. Even the Israelis themselves subsequently admitted that they were in no danger, and just chose to attack. The 1967 war is the whole reason there's still an Israeli-Palestinian conflict today, and it was started by Israel.",

Luckily Israel is a Democracy so 2-3 people cannot make a genocide. Hope the polls are accurate and Likud gets wrecked in the next election.\n\n>are not serious people\u00a0\n\nWas just having a laugh at how melodramatic and absurd you sound.

Burns was angry and embarrassed,\u00a0the same person said, believing it made him look like he wasn\u2019t in the loop or hadn\u2019t informed the Israelis of the changes.  \n  \nThe soft-spoken and mild-mannered Burns \u201calmost blew a gasket,\u201d\u00a0said the source.  \n  \nA CIA spokesperson declined to comment.  \n  \nThe three sources familiar with the matter told CNN that a senior Egyptian intelligence official named Ahmed Abdel Khalek was responsible for making the changes. Abdel Khalek is a senior deputy to the Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel,\u00a0who has been Burns\u2019 counterpart in leading Egypt\u2019s mediation in the ceasefire talks.  \n  \nOne\u00a0source\u00a0familiar with the negotiations said Abdel Khalek told the Israelis one thing and Hamas another. More of Hamas\u2019 demands were inserted into\u00a0the original framework that Israel had tacitly agreed to in order to secure Hamas\u2019 approval, the source said.\u00a0But the other mediators were not informed; nor, critically, were the Israelis.  \n  \n\u201cHamas was telling their people,\u00a0\u2018We will have a deal in place tomorrow,\u2019\u201d the first source said.  \n  \n\u201cAll sides were under the assumption the Egyptians provided the same document\u201d that Israel had signed off on and the other mediators, the US and Qatar, were aware of,\u00a0the person said.",

Palestinians had the chance for immediate self determination at the start of this conflict. They instead sought to deny the Jewish state their own right to self determination.

They've literally never been willing to accept the right of self determination for the Jews of the land\n\nAnd what had the Jewish state been doing during that time? Well, it offered Palestinians statehood at *multiple different times*. All the way back in 1948, as well as more recently in 2000 at Camp David and even more recently at Annapolis in 2007-8. But each and every time, Palestine refused to accept it. \n\nAfter all these wars, all these offers of Palestinian statehood, and all this time where Palestine remains set on the goal of destruction of the Jewish state, it is indeed perfectly reasonable to accept Israeli self determination as a given and the default while requiring far more requirements for a Palestinian state to ever exist. It's not a double standard because when we look at the history, the two sides are just very different and one side is far more unjust and unreasonable here",

These are documented in Israel\u2019s archives and have been reported on by Israeli historians such as Ilan Pappe and Benny Gantz. \n\nFact: Israel refused to allow Arab civilians to return to their homes, and confiscated all property, despite this being illegal under international law (then and now). Arab citizens were subjected to legal discrimination, and to this day are on average poorer than Jewish citizens of Israel, and are not allowed access to many government programs. \n\nFact: Israeli settlers consistently steal Palestinian land in the West Bank, and until 10/7 2024 was the deadliest year in history for Palestinians in the West Bank. These settlers, many of whom are heavily armed, face no meaningful oversight or resistance from the IDF, and have killed American citizens in recent months. \n\nTelling only one side of the story, you might get the impression that Palestinians are cartoon-villains.

Palestinians haven't been fighting for their freedom, they've been fighting in order to try and destroy the Zionist state. If they'd just give up and accept coexistence with the Zionist state, they'd have been able to have a state of their own. And even now, the 2/6 of Israel's population who are Palestinian are safe and sound and the Palestinians in Gaza are only unsafe because the rabid animals of Hamas literally use them as human shields in order to get them killed and then wave their corpses to the world as propaganda to demonize Israel.

Oh wait, that didn\u2019t work out did it?\n\n>  just like what happened in every single Arab country in the region\n\nYou mean, what happened AFTER Israel expelled 700,000 Arabs from their homes?\n\nAgain, telling one side of a story lets you paint whoever you like as monsters.\n\n> The majority of the Arabs who left Jewish controlled territory left voluntarily, leaving because they did not want to live under Jewish rule. \n\nThis is a myth. The premier Israeli historians, Benny Morris and Ilan Pappe, confirmed from Israel\u2019s military archives that the majority were expelled by force. Regardless, force was used to prevent evacuated civilians from returning to their homes. \n\nYou might be tempted to call this a lie of course, but stop and think: isn\u2019t civilians evacuating a good thing? So, even if you were right about them leaving voluntarily\u2026 why couldn\u2019t they return once the active conflict ended? They had a right to, didn\u2019t they? Then when their homes were confiscated by the Israeli state, that was theft\u2026 right?\n\n> There were some isolated incidents, largely by more fringe paramilitaries like Irgun rather than Haganah, that did indeed involve violence and force, and that was bad\n\nAnd the perpetrators punished? And the victims compensated and allowed to return? You\u2019ll find the answer to both is \u201cno.\u201d\n\n> But it is just ahistorical to act like that was the norm rather than the exception\n\nIf I provide you with evidence from Israel\u2019s military archives that show military force and threats of violence were the norm and not the exception, will you believe it?",

The Jews are the original indigenous inhabitants of the land, and maintained presence there for millennia. The idea that they didn't have some claim to the land in 1948 makes no sense, if anything they had more claim in some ways. At any rate the UN partition plan to ensure both peoples of the land got self determination was reasonable, and the Palestinian attempt to reject that and force their totalist goal by force was both unjust and a pathetic failure, as has been all their following attempts to steal the land all for themselves. They don't get to claim it all for themselves and that will never ever be reasonable\n\n>Yes they did.\n\nIn the 1948 West German election, over 70% of Germans voted for one of the big 3 democratic parties (SDP, FDP, and CSU/CSU) with an additional 5% voting for KPD. The closest party to the old Nazis, the DRP, got like 1.8% of the vote. That sure doesn't sound like clinging to Nazism. In 1953, they got 1.1% of the vote. In 1957 just 1%. That doesn't sound like Nazism maintaining much support in Germany after WWII",

The dogmatic support and anti-Semitic equating of Isreali policy with Jewdiasm as a whole has made these kinds of statements political suicide for many, unfortunately, and has tied Bidens hands on pushing back agaisnt Isreal. I hope more Americans wake up to the fact that excusing the reckless killing of civilians by an ethno-nationalist nation as something representative of the Jewish faith is anti-semitic, freeing up officials ability to actually push back agaisnt support for the actions Isreal is taking.\n\n> will utilize all my power as President to ensure this happens and I urge congress to join me.\u201d\n\nThis really depends on what is done by Biden. Other than using the bully pulpit, economic divestment, and chilling diplomatic support, this could end up in \"influencing a sovergn nations election\" territory. At the end of the day, Isreal is a sovereign nation, and they deserve fair and free elections.",

Even without tunnel systems, insurgencies have been known to reenter opposing territory to conduct ambushes, but especially the Hamas tunnel system was always understood to pose this risk.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't think Netanyahu has a solid strategy, so I don't disagree with that point, but the reentry of Hamas fighters into IDF-controlled areas like Northern Gaza isn't very good evidence of that claim. In fact, using the tunnel systems to enter Israel itself and abduct people has been a consistent Hamas policy for years (this was how they got Gilad Shalit, for example).\n\n\nThere are a number of articles about the tunnel system, so I'll paste a few:\n\n\nhttps://mwi.westpoint.edu/underground-nightmare-hamas-tunnels-and-the-wicked-problem-facing-the-idf/\n\n\nhttps://mwi.westpoint.edu/gazas-underground-hamass-entire-politico-military-strategy-rests-on-its-tunnels/\n\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/graphics/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS/GAZA-TUNNELS/gkvldmzorvb/\n\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/02/tunnels-hamas-israel-struggle-gaza-war",

The US maintains no significant bases in Israel, and aside from some HumInt from Mossad, there's very little in the matter of two-way participation in regional security.  Israel is actually more of a handicap than anything else, as seen by their unilateral strikes on Iranian officials in Syria back in April. They openly provoke conflicts with their neighbors, to which the US is almost always saddled with trying to defuse. \n\n>The US does not want to risk alienating Israel, out of fear that they'll ally up with China in response. \n\nNext to zero chance of this happening.  Every single Israelis fighter jet and combat helicopter is American-made, and Israel is completely dependent on US supplies for replacements and compatible munitions.  They would also immediately lose their F-35s, which wouldn't be allowed to remain in Israel due to the sensitivity of their technology.  Even a *sniff* of involvement with the Chinese government would bring swift and decisive, and irreparable, action from the US government.  All of their ground munitions are NATO calibers.\n\nThey would have to essentially rebuild their entire military from the ground up, buying all new Chinese equivalents.",

The United Nations, ICC, ICJ, ICRC, ect do not exist because the world just woke up one day and decided they wanted to sing kumbaya around the campfire and hug eachother. They were formed because we had two very brutal world wars where millions were slaughtered, raped, land stolen, bloodlines purged, nations looted or erased completely, so much unspeakable, unimaginable death and destruction and just pure evil. And I\u2019m sure you understand that before  those world wars things also wasn\u2019t exactly fine and dandy. We dropped TWO (2) Nukes on Japan after they were already preparing to surrender. The Holocaust that Zionist loves using to justify and defend their war crimes? That\u2019s why the court that is trying to arrest Bibi today was created. \n\nThe reasons why we have have what is called war crimes is so saying \u201cit\u2019s the coat of a shit war\u201d is not an excuse. That is quite literally why it\u2019s called a WAR crime.  \n\nHistory has judged those conplicit for those atrocities  for their own political gain very harshly and I don\u2019t see why that rightful judgement would change now. I believe Joe Biden is funding and defending a genocide. I hate him for it. I am voting for him this fall. I understand this will get worse with Trump in office. I understand what project 2025 means. I understand he must never see the White House again.\n\nI also understand that Joe Biden and the democrats are not stupid and knows all this. But they decided that AIPAC money for their campaigns and Israeli imperial interests  are more important than beating Trump, and more important to them then the voters they are losing. Asking people to be okay with funding the deliberate mass slaughter of children is a very tall order. It\u2019s not  the same thing as Hillary\u2019s emails, is it? So please remember to hold your elected officials accountable as much as you do those who are angered by their tax dollars are being used to turn children to ash.",

Biden started out by saying that he didn\u2019t think any senator had \u201cever done more fundraisers for AIPAC,\u201d a group whose supporters were key backers of his 1988 presidential campaign. He then worked himself up to the point where he was shouting and beating his chest for emotional effect as he lambasted an unprecedented public campaign by George H.W. Bush to push Israel toward engaging with Palestinians\u2019 demands for sovereignty and an end to the Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and other territory seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.\n\nAt the time, Bush was demanding that Israel stop building settlements in occupied territory in violation of international law if it wanted to receive billions of dollars in loan guarantees from the United States to support the arrival of Soviet Jews. He knew that groups like AIPAC considered this to be an affront, but he believed his actions were necessary to advance peace talks. Biden was far from the only member of Congress who opposed Bush, but he did so with uncommon fervor.\n\nArticles in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs noted that some listeners \u201csquirmed with embarrassment\u201d as Biden ranted about how the issue of American aid for Israel had become \u201csusceptible to demagoguery.\u201d \u201cYou know, no one should take Biden seriously here. He is a cheerleader,\u201d one attendee said. \u201cHe helps us, of course, but does opposing the peace talks or ignoring them or disparaging them really make sense? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nThe most revealing part of the AIPAC speech was Biden\u2019s explanation of what remain the two pillars of his approach to Israel and Palestine. First, he told the audience that he kept his criticism of things like settlements, which he opposed, between him and Israel. Second, he made sure the two nations maintained a united front so that \u201cthe Arabs\u201d would bend. These beliefs explained his disgust with what he considered to be a destined-to-fail effort by Bush to exert leverage over Israel and its right-wing prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir.\n\nWhen folks at an AIPAC fundraiser are getting uncomfortable, you're probably a zealot.",

The idea that Palestinian protesters believe Joe Biden is Prime Minister of Israel just seems like a strawman.\n\n\n> It also obfuscates the fact that we are still sending Aid to palestinainas something that would immediately stop if a republican controls the White House.\n\nI don't think providing aid to the group that is experiencing genocide entails that one is not complicit in or supporting the genocide",

Genuinely? I think he should be doing more than he is, but with or without the US' support, I'm pretty Israel would still be committing these heinous crimes. Then there is the practical reason. Blaming it all on Joe, is dumb when this is the United States as a whole problem. Our entire fucking government supports the ethnic cleansing. We all buy shirts and shit that have been complicit in the genocide of Uyghur's in China. The US support for Israel during this time would be the virtually the same or even worse under anyone else.

And I'm pretty sure that I **would** use that leverage even if I likely would vote for the 'lesser evil' in the end anyway. \n\nWith all that said my point is: I find it quite likely that a large part of the americans who are talking about not voting for Biden right now **will** vote for him in November but they are absolutely right in pressuring him with the possibility of not voting for him. And I think the fact that so many are using these tactics right now is more a sign of how bad a winner-takes-all voting system is than a sign of how 'dumb American leftists are'.\n\nAnd that applies to pretty much every fptp System, not only to the US. The Brits are in my eyes even worse at the moment since labour pretty much can't lose the next election at all if they don't fuck up their campaign this year massively and as far as I can tell the commited labour voters still attack leftists for being tories in sheep's clothing so to say.",

Sure that is their biggest piece of leverage, but I think they are misusing it, because a trump election would be worse for Palestine and everyone else.

Protests as a whole can make a difference in US policy, but I fail to see how that slogan helps change US policy.\n\nIt is all a balancing curve to me. Changing US policy on Gaza and getting Biden reelected are both very important. The genocide Joe slogan hurts Biden's reelection odds, and doesn't do anything to change either the public opinion of what's happening in Gaza or change the government's stance",

The standard of evidence for a warrant is only \"reasonable to believe,\" and not \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" like a trial conviction. There's little reason to think that any significant political pressure will sway the current judges on the panel (from Romania, Mexico and Benin). Warrants requested are almost always granted by the ICC because the ICC doesn't pursue cases rashly. If Khan has submitted the warrant requests, he's almost certain of them being granted. Especially in a case this highly controversial with major powers like the US. \n\nNow, whether or not those warrants will ever result in an arrest is a different question. The US will likely not allow them to be executed, and Israel almost certainly will not, even if Netanyahu is eventually prosecuted in Israel for the crimes he has already been charged with. So unless Netanyahu tries to travel somewhere that will enforce the Rome Statute and ICC warrants, he can spend the rest of his life hiding in Israel or the US.",
