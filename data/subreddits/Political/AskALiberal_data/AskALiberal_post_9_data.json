            "body": "The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.\n\nLiberals have this idea that men and women are only the way they are because of social conditioning.\n\nBut when you look at certain statistics like the fact that [96.7% of Kindergarten teachers are women](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2024/02/12/over-96-of-kindergarten-teachers-are-women-research-shows-heres-how-to-attract-more-men/), that really makes me wonder. Is the idea that women don't have a natural aptitude with children despite being the sex that carries and gives birth to children and has the ability to feed children with their female organs?\n\nIs there a problem with Early Education engaging in systemic discrimination against men? Seems unlikely.\n\nSame with nursing, which is 88% women, according to that same article. Another profession that has to do with nurturing/caring/people-centric. This one doesn't have to do with children but the similarities are clear. Does the Nursing profession systemically discriminate against men too?\n\nWas my 4 year old niece socially conditioned into liking dolls and pretty things, along with most other little girls? I'm not sure about that. I mean the least we can say is that the social conditioning doesn't take long at all, and this conditioning is very powerful because girls and boys seem to gravitate to these gendered things, despite only a short time of conditioning.\n\nAnother thing that makes me wonder regarding the social conditioning argument: \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing_theory&oldid=515528642#Evolutionary_explanations_for_sex_differences)\\]\n\n>research on one-day-old babies has found that boys look longer at a mechanical mobile while girls look longer at a face. This, as well as the effects of fetal testosterone on later behavior, is argued to be evidence against the sex differences being only due to socialization.\"\n\nI don't know, I think this argument that sex differences are purely the result of social conditioning is one of the weaker liberal arguments.\n\nDo you really think social conditioning is the only reason for differences between the sexes? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "> only the way they are because of social conditioning\n\nUntrue. You would be hard pressed to find a liberal who believes that men and women are the way they are SOLELY due to social conditioning. \n\n> But when you look at certain statistics \n\nThese statistics don't really discount the idea that women are socially conditioned to be caregivers, though. They might actually reinforce it. \n\n> Was my 4 year old niece socially conditioned into liking dolls and pretty things, along with most other little girls?\n\nAt least partially, yes. \n\n> I think this argument that sex differences are purely the result of social conditioning is one of the weaker liberal arguments.\n\nGood thing it's not one the liberal arguments, then.",

Nor do I think it's a particularly productive exercise. \n\nLiberals acknowledge that differences between men and women include behavioral differences, just as they do physical ones. \n\nI think a lot of the reason why liberals have been banging the drum of \"social conditioning\" in recent years is due to conservatives' refusal to believe it plays a significant role - largely because they want to discount the experiences of trans people.",

Steven Pinker wrote a whole book that is nothing but this strawman writ large. This is not accurate. I believe many things are related to socialization, and bio-deterministic explanations fall short in many areas, but there are biological factors that explain some tendencies and differences.\n\n>Is there a problem with Early Education engaging in systemic discrimination against men? Seems unlikely.\n\nI don't know why you would find that unlikely. As a man I am hesitant to be around children at all because of the kinds of accusations that fly. I've seen men be pretty actively counseled out of pursuing careers in Early Childhood Education.\n\n>Same with nursing, which is 88% women, according to that same article. Another profession that has to do with nurturing/caring/people-centric. This one doesn't have to do with children but the similarities are clear. Does the Nursing profession systemically discriminate against men too?\n\nIt doesn't have to be discrimination; in this case it's largely socialization. Little boys who say they want to grow up to be nurses are not given the same encouragement as little girls who say they want to grow up to be nurses.",

Both my parents and my brother are nurses-not only were there many steps that were taken in school to discourage them, and hold them to a higher standard in a similar way women are held to a higher standard in STEM or the trades, they continue to have additional barriers put in place by the hospitals they work at and their own patients with biases against males in nursing because something must be wrong with them. Our systems absolutely shape where and how men with those interests go. \n\nAlso, having had that many (plus two aunts) be nurses and spending much of my life around others, I can tell you that many of them are not in the field because of some interest in caring or nurturing but because it cost less time and money than med school when they find medicine fascinating or because it\u2019s a pretty high paying job for someone who isn\u2019t business minded. Just because a job has caring components doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s why people do it (see doctors, therapists, college professors, etc) so the gendered/sex based arguments fall off quickly.",

I said there are no inherent physiological and psychological differences which would make men less suitable to being successful in a caregiving setting such as kindergarten\u2014 all skills needed to be kind, attentive, and respectful to children can be learned and are not inherent to any gender. Nobody is better suited to working with children naturally and being a truly great teacher takes effort. :)",

With a couple of kids in the house, he wasn\u2019t really getting out that much and she probably primarily only had dinner at home, paternal grandparents house, my house and another friend of the families house.\n\nThe thing is is that all of those homes the husband did all the cooking. It never even occurred to my friend that that was the case because why would it? Not really something you think about.\n\nSo he\u2019s at his in-laws and his daughter walks into the kitchen and she sees her father cooking. But she also sees her grandmother and her aunt cooking. \n\nSo when they get back from their trip, my friend shares this hilarious story about how his daughter ran off to find her mother and tell her that something weird was going on in the kitchen because there were girls cooking and girls don\u2019t cook. Her little toddler brain was very concerned that the food would be no good or even unsafe.\n\nIt is perfectly fine to acknowledge the obvious reality that there are differences that are for lack of better term nature based between men and women. But if you think that and that alone results in 96.7%. Of kindergarten teachers being women, you are unfortunately stuck where my friends daughter was years ago.\n\nAnd I suspect the entire point of this conversation, that what you were saying is both misogynistic and misandrist, is not something you\u2019re going to be able to understand.",

They seem to know who their father and mother are, and that they are their parents and know what the difference between the two are.\n\n   Ther first question asked by a 5 year old is why don't you have a wife ect, then sexual orientation comes to the forefront.   The answer is that that person is homosexual, or gay, lesbian what ever they want to answer and that brings up a ton questions that a 5-6 year old does not need to consider, nor do their parents need to educate a 65 month old child on, there is plenty of time to let them know.   The need to consider running, jumping, napping, counting, colors ect.   That is not appropriate for that age child.    And what good does that information do for a 5 year old except confusion because they cannot understand lust (except for sugary substances), intimacy sexual desire ect, unless they have been abused.

To the point that I\u2019ve started to wonder if the big issue is that social conservatives are much less engaged than other parents in their children\u2019s education.\n\nSo they default to thinking about these issues the way they think about them, disgust and insanity.\n\nThat sick person at LibsOfTikTok found one objectionable book at a few schools and that means porn is given to kindergartners. \n\nApparently, you think that your kids at five years old could not mentally process that while most people marry or love someone of the opposite sex some people don\u2019t. With that for them to understand that they have to have detailed explanations of anal sex or fisting or something?\n\nBecause I got to tell you, at five years old, my kids understood the basics of both homosexual and heterosexual couples, but did not have an understanding of penis goes in vagina or anything like that. But they did get basic sex ed when they were five, mostly concentrating on the fact that they have private parts and only certain people were able to see and touch those areas. \n\nAnd that\u2019s what really bothers me. Social conservatives are setting up a world in which proper sex ed cannot be taught to small children, and the only people who benefit from that are actual pedophiles.",

Education and nurturing and caregiving.\n\nWe also have lots of social traditions around the idea that regardless of any other factors, men are supposed to be the primary breadwinner and women are supposed to be secondary breadwinners. And so jobs that are coded for women pay less and women are the default for hiring and jobs that pay more are coded male And the default hiring practice is to select men.\n\nAnd as feminist have been pointing out since forever, this is part of toxic masculinity and patriarchy. We have strong social stigma around men doing jobs that put them in proximity to children. Because men are not supposed to do childcare, even if it\u2019s for their own children. So the only kind of man who would want to be around young children is assumed to be a pedophile .",

Men who want to teach children are often accused of being pedophiles.\n\n>Same with nursing, which is 88% women, according to that same article. Another profession that has to do with nurturing/caring/people-centric. This one doesn't have to do with children but the similarities are clear. Does the Nursing profession systemically discriminate against men too?\n\nYeah, there probably is some discrimination against men in nursing. The bigger issue is that for a long time, nursing and education were seen as women's jobs and it takes a long time for society to change from that view. Men don't become nurses or teachers of young children because men can't imagine themselves doing those jobs. There's also the problem of those jobs being paid pretty badly, which is also a result of discrimination against women.\n\n>Was my 4 year old niece socially conditioned into liking dolls and pretty things, along with most other little girls? I'm not sure about that. I mean the least we can say is that the social conditioning doesn't take long at all, and this conditioning is very powerful because girls and boys seem to gravitate to these gendered things, despite only a short time of conditioning.\n\nYep, this is bang on.\n\nLet me ask you, when your niece got her first toys, did she pick what they were or did her parents pick what they were? That's how the conditioning starts.\n\nThe experiment thing sounds very suspect to me. The metric they're measuring seems fraught with potential issues, and psychology research in general is not very trustworthy because of the severe replicability problem in the psychology field.",

You don't know if I was told this in the 70s, the 90s, or yesterday. \n\nYou and OP are missing the point when you immediately jump to \"you should sue,\" and now I have to have a conversation with you and my priest about statutes of limitations, conveniently sidestepping the point about social stuff.\n\nGood work; I look like an asshole to you because you're looking into a black mirror.\n__",

You can\u2019t (practically or ethically) raise a child in the absence of social conditioning. You can make small changes in a controlled environment, like showing kids pictures of possible careers either matching their gender or with typical gender coding and seeing if it changes how they answer questions about what they want to be when they grow up, but you can\u2019t learn how much it matters overall. \n\nAn experiment like that is overcoming the conditioning they\u2019ve received, so what if they\u2019d never been exposed to gendered expectations? Would additional representation of female engineers or male nurses have greater impact each time or diminishing returns? \n\nThat\u2019s before you get into what pieces of social conditioning and inherent differences, and their combinations, are having what affect. Are women not becoming engineers because they think they\u2019re bad at it? Driven out by toxic company culture? Male-dominated fields are less receptive to working mothers? Do men think they\u2019d be bad kindergarten teachers? They\u2019d be looked down on? Never even consider it as an option? \n\nWhile the gender breakdown in careers would likely not be 50-50 even in the absence of any gendered expectations, we don\u2019t know what the baseline is. All we know is that social/cultural effects are currently shifting us away from that unknowable baseline an unknown amount.",

            "body": "Child development professional here (bachelors in it and pending masters degree). There are no inherent skills women posses which make them better at caregiving, nor are there natural detriments for men who wish to pursue caregiving. What makes a good caregiver is someone who is patient, responsive, and connected - all of which are personality traits you can find in all genders and can also be learned in all genders. It is also notable to children require a lot of diversity in their caregivers to help them develop socially and emotionally - so not only is there no reason for men to avoid caregiving, it is actively positive when they do engage with it! \n\nThe current disparity in childcare and education professions is because of social conditioning to see women as inherently gifted with providing care services and men as inherently unable to provide them - and this starts young. Before the age of 7 children have unparalleled neural growth and the patterns for the rest of their life are formed. Sexism is insidious and can be introduced nonchalantly, such as encouraging girls to only play with dolls or telling a young boy not to cry or hug his friends These interactions form the framework for the child\u2019s sense of self, and if they are reinforced by other messages such as 1) only witnessing women providing care in the form of mothers, teachers, nurses, babysitters, etc, 2) only witnessing anger or stoic displays from important male figures, 3) consuming media where parenthood or caregiving is portrayed as a woman\u2019s job, or 4) receiving interactions where the emotional male self is stunted in favor of aggression or bullying tactics \u2014 then their \u201csocial script\u201d has been written and their brain will create pathways accordingly. Many women feel expected to seek out such careers or bringing caregiving into other places, and many men feel as though they cannot care for children because they have not been given the social and emotional tools to do so. These subconscious early associations show up as \u201cgut feelings\u201d and impulses or reactions against anything other than the social norm. It is why people feel weird about men working with children. \n\nWith all that in mind, it is unsurprising to me that men are shamed, chased out, and discouraged from taking on kindergarten lead teaching positions. Sexism demands that men live apart from children because it is \u201cwoman\u2019s work\u201d, and a society which follows a sexist standard react unkindly when they see anyone -  man, woman, or child - going against it.\n\nan edit: it is also important to consider that many roles and careers branded as \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d are historically underpaid and overworked, as well as the professionals in those places receiving a lot of abuse and stress. Many times you will find men in administrative positions such as principal, director, or lead counselor while the women occupy the teachers, caregivers, and social workers of these places - more work for less money. It is a structure which harkens back to the time of indentured servant nannies and wives who couldn\u2019t vote, further demonizing men who wish to take an active role in the caregiving profession while also devaluing the role of women who already work there.",

These are not feminine traits but are instead linked to the amount of language and communication developmental levels that young children are capable of.

Because of those biological features. Early childhood education is often seen as an extension of mothering. And because of those biological features, motherly behaviors and instincts are often encouraged as girls age AKA reinforced. \n\n> Is there a problem with Early Education engaging in systemic discrimination against men? Seems unlikely.\n\nWhy does it seem unlikely? There's quite a lot of writings out there talking about the double edged sword men deal with working in ECE either being tokenized or looked at with suspicion of their motivations because it doesn't fit within the traditional box thay society expects men to fit into[^1](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1708/walking-gendered-lines-the-contradictory-expectations-of-men-who-work-in-early-childhood-education)\n\n> Does the Nursing profession systemically discriminate against men too?\n\nAgain there's quite a lot of writings, studies, etc also out there discussing the challenges men face in this female dominated industry too ranging from tokenization to being perceived as a sexual threat. \n\n> Was my 4 year old niece socially conditioned into liking dolls and pretty things, along with most other little girls?... social conditioning doesn't take long at all, and this conditioning is very powerful because girls and boys seem to gravitate to these gendered things, despite only a short time of conditioning.\n\nThis is moving more into early childhood development. Some of it is innate and some of it is social conditioning. As a wise man once said. \"A little bit of column A and a little bit of column B\"\n\nTo summarize I guess. It's not nature OR nurture when it comes to what makes use the way we are but nature AND nurture. A boy might naturally gravitate towards mechanically interesting toys, this interest is also reinforced socially when friends family and parents only buy them toys geared towards traditionally boyish interests. Women might have a natural maternal instinct AND men who would otherwise be interested in ECE are discouraged through questioning of their motivations for working in such a field.",

I noticed it, and so did my parents and in laws - the majority of dropper offers and picker uppers were the dads. Dad's driving Land Rovers, but it was the men. That shouldn't be unusual, but it is. \n\nI had a thought, why not staff the day care with majority men? Men can certainly look after small children for 8 hours a day, they trust us with critical care patients (if you are licensed for it), we can change a mean diaper, we can comfort a child, and kids generally like us. I had to drop the thought because I realized no one would send their kid to a daycare staffed only by men. We aren't *there* yet. \n\nNow, on the point about saying social conditioning is a weak argument, it is only weak because people are ignorant. The fact is, controlled properly for biases and repeating them, we find very few cognitive differences between the sexes. in other words, a 'female' brain is just a human brain attached to a female body. Yes, there are different hormones, but that doesn't seem to fundamentally change the way we view the world. We, simultaneously find it very challenging to see out of our culture for anything. Like, look at all of this talk about 'grooming', kids in ancient cultures were around sex and nudity all the damn time. Have you ever been to a classical museum in Europe? There are erect phalluses all over the place! That was their culture, we would find that abhorrent but that only informs us as to how oppressive a culture truly is. It has the power to *entirely* shape your perspective. \n\nYes, your niece was socially conditioned to like girl centric dolls. Boys like boy centric dolls, they are both dolls but because of our social conditioning we can't actually call the boy's toy a doll, it must be an *action figure*. Similarly, the term for the thing you put on in the morning to make you smell good is called a perfume, for men and women. Our culture demands we call it a cologne, even though colognes are also for both men and women. That may seem like a trivial example, but it is part of a much larger ecosystem. You don't think your niece is being socially conditioned because you don't perceive that you are doing that, but how did the dolls end up in her possession? It is almost like there is an entire industry designed to sell toys to girls. Say you manage to raise a girl to 4 without falling into that trap, then they spend a few hours with grandma who promptly buys them a bunch of pink stuff and tells them explicitly this is what girls want/like. You are assuming that these kids are organically separating themselves and their interests, that is a convenient perspective is it not? It absolves us, the adults, of any responsibility in it and we can just say \"see, this is what they *naturally* like and who are we to question it?\" That doesn't mean it is inherently wrong for a girl to like a doll in a pink dress, I am saying it is awfully convenient of us to develop a *just so* explanation while scoffing at the idea this is all essentially manufactured. \n\nSocial conditioning is 24/7/365 situation, it is happening all the time, by all the people, by all the media, you can't get away from it. That isn't an insult, it is just a reality. A lot of us seem to have the thought that we can reason our way out of that, that we aren't truly conditioned, that we are *independent* thinkers. That is just your smart brain doing some ego-protecting behavior. We really aren't, and even the smart among us are socially conditioned.",
