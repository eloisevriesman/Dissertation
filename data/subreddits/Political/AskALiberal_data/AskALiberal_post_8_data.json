Your starting point in life, how you were raised, your innate skills, internal drive, etc.  \n\nSo many factors go into it, but how can you equalize even most things? It\u2019s easy to say \u201coh everyone can start from the same place\u201d, but  can they? The social and professional connections your parents make as well as how they raise you definitely play a factor in your life circumstances.  \n\nLet\u2019s say there\u2019s a guy who bakes the most amazing cakes. It isn\u2019t a secret recipe either so the office of resource management can\u2019t beat it out of him and make it public knowledge. He uses his skills to curry favor with people who provide other luxuries. His kids through exposure and their own innate abilities also learn these talents, but he doesn\u2019t bother to teach anyone else. He spends time with other people with talents like his and they enrich each other\u2019s lives but *not* the general public.  \n\nIsn\u2019t that the same class-based system we have now, substituting money with talent?  \n\nBonus Question: straight ladies do you expect a dude to pay on the first date? I generally just ask to split but this date was the first time someone said they thought I would have covered it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You probably know people who grow vegetables in the garden or knit sweaters or build things or bake cakes as a hobby.  I have an aunt who is retired and does nothing but crochet; she is desperate to find things to crochet for people, find people who will take sweaters, etc. so her house doesn't overflow\n* Capitalist industrial society alienates people from that joy of production by turning everything ugly and transactional.  Work is needlessly unpleasant under capitalism.\n* But what if (in part because technology helps to solve issues of scarcity) we could reclaim that joy of production?\n* Then we enter into a utopia where each person produces according to their ability (and desire) and consumes according to their need.  The people who take joy in baking bake to their heart's content, and then people who need something to eat take the baked goods and eat them.\n* This is a classless society because with everyone taking delight in production, there's plenty to go around, and everyone has enough of everything quasi-effortlessly.  You don't need to curry favor with anyone because there's abundance.\n\nDoes that work out? Not really.  There's no reason to suppose that joyful production will match the things we need, and there are jobs in society that need to be done that will probably never provide joy.  But Marx was certainly putting his finger on some things that are real; in a utopia, my aunt would crochet sweaters for all who wanted them.",

It depends on economic contexts but like, an upper class is often understood as a group of people who can comfortably afford a pretty luxurious life and so on.\n\nBased on this, there's the assumption that class differences cause power inequalities that are for one reason or another considered to be unjust. For example, people born into poor families have lower chances of becoming successful in their job industry.\n\nSo the promise of classless society seems to be the image of society mostly without material differences.",

People do tasks that are even individually pretty unpleasant because they need to get done. Because what we can value is helping people around us, because we have a sense of valuing things running smoothly and having a nice shared space. There are lots of situations where people are connected to their labor regardless of whether it's fun.\n\nThere are lots of things that can make us connected to our labor.

Like for instance the first iteration of liberalism was a criticism of monarchy and how monarchies are arbitrary and flawed. Concepts like nobility and birthrights were BS. That things like free enterprise, individualism, democracy, science, expertise, expertise, merit based rewards were superior to a presumed \"natural order\" the history of liberalism is basically a fight between conservatives that at every turn conservatives freak out and think that society is going to crumble if some tradition or old hierarchy is disbanded and resisting liberal attempts to upend it. \n\nLiberalism expanded into ideas like race/ethnicity shouldn't hold people back, that the government should work to make accomodations to advance human potential like the \"ADA, Civil Rights, Healthcare, Welfare.\" While maintaining a market based competitive society ultimately based on merit. \n\nConservatives have evolved in the west to adopt some liberal positions in an assumed consensus, established by previous waves of successful liberalism, but they stand against whatever the newest strand of liberalism is, and potentially even against recent(in living memory) liberal successes. \n\nA \"classless society\" is a pipe dream that will never happen, at least not any time soon. Most people know this liberal or conservative. We can see the monumental failures in mid century communism to achieve this. We can look at every human civilization that has ever existed and conclude that realistically people will categorize themselves and others into groups. Liberalism isn't terribly concerned with making everyone equal in outcomes. In fact liberals believe in the \"profit motive\" as a positive thing. Modern liberalism however does want to give everyone a chance at competing for profit and being rewarded. \n\nLiberals will often look at disparities between groups and look to government policies to bridge those gaps. This is not done with the purpose of eliminating rich people or even poor people(as these concepts are relative) but to identify ways in which people are disadvantaged and then try to bridge that gap so that everyone is starting from the same point. This doesn't mean that in the end everyone will be equal. \n\nConservatives are often accused of believing that there is no point to this because groups of people have different innate traits, either generic or cultural that give them advantages or disadvantages and that this is not up to government policy to change.",

However\n\n>Conservatives have evolved in the west to adopt some liberal positions in an assumed consensus, established by previous waves of successful liberalism, but they stand against whatever the newest strand of liberalism is, and potentially even against recent(in living memory) liberal successes. \n\nLiberal and conservative are broad categories, especially in the US. You identify as a liberal so I don't expect you to market positively for conservatives. But I think this characterization really gets to the heart of the issue. Conservative could mean any number of ideologies. I'm not going to deny that there is a branch of conservativism that is simply reactionary. But there are other branches that genuinely believe their policies will lead to a more equitable and prosperous society. Not every conservative is a knee jerk reactionary. \n\n>the history of liberalism is basically a fight between conservatives that at every turn conservatives freak out and think that society is going to crumble if some tradition or old hierarchy is disbanded and resisting liberal attempts to upend it. \n\nThis is the righteous narrative that liberals generally present, but it's not true at all. History is rife with policies that liberals advocated for that were opposed by conservatives. Some, like restrictive zoning, or prohibition, or sterilization of mentally handicapped people became law and proved to be monumentally destructive. Others, like free silver, never became policy. \n\nThe common response is a disingenuous form of the no true scotsman fallacy, which would be to claim that 'the majority of liberals in 2024 don't support those policies, therefore they weren't liberal policies'. However, by that standard, your above statement would be incorrect, as conservatives today support an established liberal policy, therefore the opponents years ago weren't true conservatives. \n\n>Conservatives are often accused of believing that there is no point to this because groups of people have different innate traits, either generic or cultural that give them advantages or disadvantages and that this is not up to government policy to change.\n\nThe key word is accused. And the other key word is groups. Yes, conservatives are often accused of that by liberals. But that's usually because it's easier to call them a racism than to debate in good faith. While some people identify as conservative and also believe certain 'groups' have certain innate traits, it's a minority. The majority of conservatives believe *each individual* has different traits.

Some Republicans especially in the past were more liberal than conservative. The past had many Democrats that were more  conservative than liberal. \n\nSome policies, let's take the idea of prohibition would be considered a conservative progressive policy. Undeniably the thought of restricting personal use of alcohol is illiberal, however it's also progressive because the aim was to use government policy to improve the country through government intervention.  \n\nEven a liberal like myself has conservative views in some areas. Plenty of people on the left are not exactly liberals, some openly oppose liberalism as an ideology. \n\nLiberalism has utterly failed to achieve its own goals plenty of times. However forced sterilization, restrictive zoning and prohibition are not liberal policies. Did liberals support them at times yes. Particularly Eugenics, many otherwise liberal people supported Eugenic policies. The question I have with that is...how is Eugenics liberal aside from liberal intellectuals supporting it? Sometimes it gets complicated. For instance being pro-choice, that is liberal under the fact that it falls under personal choice and individual freedom. However forced sterilization of poor or infirmed people for the good of society is the opposite of liberal. Did liberals and people on the left support this illiberal policy for a time...yes. \n\nZoning laws are illiberal. Generally speaking the entire zoning process is trapped into less partisan, even more special interest influenced local politics sphere. \n\nWhat is liberal which also causes problems regarding housing is community hearings. One way that I break with liberalism and would welcome a more centralized system is this overly beurocratic and obviously liberal policy of community input for local building projects contributed to housing shortages and infrastructure building. \n\n\"Free Silver\" is also not at all liberal. It was a populist left-wing nonsense policy that is irrelevant. \n\nLiberal is more often than not left-wing but not necessarily. Conservatives sometimes support liberal ideas. There is a liberal consensus on many issues meaning many conservatives do hold liberal views. \n\nI think a better way of honestly looking at conservatives is to say they want to protect the status quo and promote a unified culture that is heavily reliant on traditional values. Not every conservative is even into this collectivist type thinking. \n\nMy point is that modern partisan US politics and politics in most liberal democracies are by definition done in liberal spaces. Many conservatives hold liberal views. Liberalism is in many ways a consensus. So...you are going to find a lot of liberalism within conservative ideologies. Less conservativism in liberal ideologies. However there are right wing and left wing illiberal ideologies. The far right and far left reject liberalism because it is the consensus.",

                                    "body": ">Income alone doesn\u2019t denote class or power\n\nMost liberals hold a Marxist view on class. I do as well. From that perspective, there are really only three classes; capitalists, bourgeoisie and proletariat. Your example isn't really an example of class, it's just someone with an important skill. In this case, a doctor.\n\nWhich is why I added my edit. To many on the left, a classless society genuinely means some form of 'from each according to their ability, to each according to their need'. To many on the right however, a classless society doesn't have a pithy phrase to encapsulate it, but means essentially 'without government imposed structures that allow rent seeking wealth accumulation, we can reach a point in which all people will live prosperous and productive lives. And, importantly, extreme disparity in wealth would cease to exist, because, at its core, that disparity is caused by government structures'. \n\nSo, yes, a doctor would be compensated more than a street sweeper. But the disparity between both the street sweeper and doctor, and importantly, the disparity between those two and the uber wealthy capitalist, would be much smaller and much more equitable. \n\nDo you disagree? Most people I know on the right, at least those who pay attention to things, hold the position that, while free markets are positive, as is generating wealth, the massive amount of wealth held by guys like Bezos, Musk et al, is a direct result of government policies, namely central bank led expansionary monetary policy, copyright and trademark law, and regulatory capture.",

When I said no, I'm fine splitting, he explained that he understands that in our society, women have to pay for so many more things. Our clothes are generally more expensive. Our hair and makeup is much more expensive. The time it takes us to do things is generally longer. We typically make less than men. If you live in a city, it's often not the safest for women to take public transportation at night, so often, I have to pay for Ubers. Birth control is generally the financial responsibility of women. I don't mind splitting the bill, but I also appreciated him acknowledging that. Just food for thought",

The only people who lear ed to read were either this ruling class, merchants, or clergy.\n\nThere was no \"get good grades, become a lawyer, make partner, and retire with a $6m net worth.\" \n\nOf course, there are ways to replicate dynastic wealth (boarding school, trusts, etc.), but class divisions (to the extent they exist) are highly permeable. \n\nMarx was talking about a communist, non hierarchical society, where everyone works and received UBI.",

            "body": "A classes society is a Marxist concept. Don\u2019t make the mistake of coming from a social-economic class perspective. That is a different framework which will not work here. \n\nClassless is about not having Marxist class distinctions between capital ownership and proletariat (those who must sell their labor to live). It\u2019s definitionally a property distinction. It means a society without private property. Everyone would have the same relationship to society in how they must secure their means of subsistence and social reproduction. \n\nIf you own enough property. Your life\u2019s needs (bought on the market) is secured through income based on rents and or property sales. If you rent property, you must sell your labor to an employer to get enough income to rent that property and other means of living your life. These are the two classes. \n\n\nTo answer your question. Several communities have had classless societies throughout history. Famously many North American tribes had semi nomadic and settled agricultural societies without property. Meaning they were classless. The distribution of resources and property was a matter of social arrangements inside and between families as well as convention be politics at the clan and at the tribe level. Social position (NOT class) was generally inherited. This is pretty normal in all societies. \n\nAs you can see\u2026 There lots of different answers to your question of what a classless society might be like. The only examples of modern industrialised class society we have are the Comintern countries. Now these didn\u2019t have class distinctions (though arguably in different settings party membership construed a social class separation; but that risks making this discussion too long). Of course they still had inequality and hierarchy, if much less than say the US has now. It still saw patterns of social advantage being inherited (as all societies see to some extent). \n\nThere is always a distribution of power in any setting you look at, and it\u2019s never equal. This is not some utopian switch between utopia and capitalism. What changes here is the structure in which resources like land and leadership or management of organisations such as business are allocated and controlled. How is a factory run? How is a local government run? Who controls a river? And so forth. And the system of management has enormous material impact; or no one would care about questions around property. \n\nThen ultimately, socialist will argue, those who control politics; what logic do they make decisions on? What is their aim? \n\nThe core promise of socialism (Marxist/classless or not) is that the economy will be shaped, organised, and regulated by human agency so as to serve society and human needs. And not so as to run under its own accidental historically produced logic\u2019s which produce inhuman ends (capitalism).",

Im sure there are other points but those would be the biggies. \n\nAs for paying for women on dates, my policy was that as a man, you insist on paying on the first date. It shows generosity and allows you to say \"you get the next one\" as an end run around asking for a second date. If she's really keen on gender equity (or really emphatic that there won't be a second date) she can insist on separate checks.

Nonreligious and would prefer my partner to be. I would like to settle down with someone who makes a similar amount, the more the better. I like strong, independent, and smart women who have their own jobs, friend groups, and lives. I\u2019m not even sure if I want children yet.",
