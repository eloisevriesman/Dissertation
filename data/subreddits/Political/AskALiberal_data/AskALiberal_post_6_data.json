When do you think it\u2019s acceptable to \"buy\" a puppy or kitten? For instance, if all the shelters in your area were empty and had a wait list, would it be okay to go to a breeder? Or, imagine if the US government outlawed the breeding of dogs and cats \u2013 would people have to wait for a stray to show up with a litter?\n\nI\u2019m leaning \"Team Adopt,\" but I'm wondering at what point buying might become a consideration for me.\n\nI'm trying to get an idea of what the future would look like if all dog/cat breeding were outlawed, and then these animals were given extinction risk protection by various federal wildlife agencies.. like how far are we going with this?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your perspectives! \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And when I mean volunteer, I mean she is served on the board and helped run fundraisers and is there multiple times a week. \n\nShe has never owned more than one dog at a time, but there have been times when there\u2019s four dogs in her house because the overflow at the shelter is so great that people just start taking them home temporarily.  And occasionally it\u2019s situations like the dog she brought home because he was old and blind, and there was zero chance anyone was going to adopt him so essentially it was hospice care.\n\nBut most of the time it\u2019s a young healthy dog that would do well in any family with or without kids. They have the same situation with cats and birds and so many rabbits every Easter. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s going tell you that they should shut down all breeders even now while she has a surplus. However, she has a passionate hatred of puppy mills that pump out purebred dogs that are genetically unstable due to inbreeding. \n\nHonestly, I think it\u2019s more a issue of much stronger regulations being needed",

A breeder has a female Goldendoodle.  Its 3 years old and had 2 litters. The breeder wants to retire the Goldendoodle, but doesn't want it to go to a shelter (wants to know that its future family will care for it and send updates).\n\nBut still there's an adoption fee..  like maybe $900 instead of $6000 (or whatever the going rate for a goldendoodle puppy is)\n\nWould you adopt from that \"direct from breeder\" agency? or would you wait for the dog to arrive at the ASPCA?\n\nFYI i'm not pitching anything or any business.  I was just wondering if people would be open to a gray area adoption in which you're picking up a retired breeding dog directly from a breeder.",

            "body": "With respect to dogs, (and because I care about cats about as much as they care about me...) I'm leery of adoption.   Dogs are just bundles of empathic energy... and a dog that's been abused, abandoned and/or just  plain had a bad/clueless owner is going to be more effort.  Bad habits, anxiety, willfulness, having had no discipline, or the wrong kind of discipline, etc, takes time and resources to overcome.  It breaks my heart to say no to that, because those are the dogs that need love and training the most, but I don't feel capable of properly giving it.  I like the idea of getting a puppy immediately after weaning, start training right from day one and developing a bond with it without any intervening owners having bonded or given it bad habits or the wrong kind of discipline.\n\nOn the other hand, getting a dog from a breeder is a whole other kind of hassle.     I was looking to get a boxer, pre-covid, and trying to find a breeder that didn't dock the tails and/or the ears was nigh on impossible.  It is a ridiculous and cruel standard of breeding and I don't think any dog ought be deprived of its tail or have its ears reduced.   My living situation changed when covid hit, and suddenly I didn't have the space to have a dog, so I'm glad I didn't get one.    But I'm rebuilding and maybe sometime soon can find a boxer or two to bring into the family. \n\n  \nThe other thing to think about is the possibility that the dog you adopt from the shelter might have been a breeders dog whose previous owner just didn't know what they were doing or ended up in the shelter through a possibly bizarre set of circumstances.  So you could, in adopting, be putting your feet in both problems... \n\nThat's my two cents on the debate.",

            "body": "I do some volunteer work with shelters and rescues. Here's my perspective:\n\nShopping is toxic under pretty much every modern circumstance. There are too many animals, the breeders are exploitative/badly regulated/cruel, etc., the costs of buying are huge compared to adopting, people who are not disciplined enough to go through an process probably purchase a decade+ commitment. The hyper-bred dogs have all kinds of bonus, costly health issues as well. And, even worse, the breeders constantly dump unsold \"inventory\" into the wild, increasing the need for adoptions or just creating food for the coyotes.\n\nPlus, there is just too much need for adoptions. Animals often outlive their circumstances and need somewhere to go. They don't die just because their owner died or has to move to another country or whatever.\n\nAnd if you're not sure about it, sign up to be a foster. You'll get to be a little picky, they usually give you free supplies/food/etc., and you get to \"test drive\" the animal to see if it's a good match. If not, it will get adopted and you can try another one. Make friends with the people who run the shelter and, if it turns out you were looking for some specific kind of dog, you'll be the first person to get the call for it.\n\n---\n\nSure, if your hypotheticals came true, maybe there are rare circumstances where you'd be in a situation where adoptions weren't available. But we are not anywhere near outlawing breeding or anything like that for pets. And the shelters are nowhere near empty. They only had a real shortage when Covid happened and everyone suddenly wanted a pet. After Covid, *plenty* of those animals were returned or dumped.\n\nObviously, a lot of the rescue animals are \"suboptimal\" (most people want cute babies/youth in specific breeds or colors... so that can be fairly hard to accommodate in a pure adoption situation). Lots of animals are older, may have some behavior issues, lack training, etc. - but most of those will be overcome by a good home... and shelters are understanding when someone adopts a pet and is overwhelmed by the issues that come with it. \n\nShelters would rather you bring the animal back than dump it or neglect it. \n\nAnd there are shelters all over. It would be cheaper to fly to Hawaii or Puerto Rico, spend a week on vacation and adopt an animal than to buy some very in-demand pets.",

Breed standards can create health problems.  Not all the time, and of course adopted shelter dogs are also susceptible to health problems as well...but take the bulldog, for example:  their short noses and faces make them at higher risk of heat stroke (they can't pant enough to reduce temperature) and other breathing problems.  I don't think that possible health issues is a reason not to buy a dog from a breeder, but if you are a first time dog owner, you might want to hedge your bets with a dog that is less at-risk.\n\n2.  You might not be a dog person (and that's okay!).  Say you get a dog and realize \"Oh fuck, I thought this would be a lot easier.\"  It happens.  So, sadly, you have to rehome the dog...but would you rather be out a few hundred dollars or a few thousand?",
