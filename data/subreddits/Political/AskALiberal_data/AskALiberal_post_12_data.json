            "body": "The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.\n\nThe state of Ohio, among possibly others, is denying Biden from being on the presidential ballot because the Democratic Convention is technically beyond the date at which state law says a candidate can be certified. Past Republican and Democratic conventions have also violated this law, but were \"waived\" in some way to allow balloting. I'm not sure if those past waivers were official acts, or something that falls more into a grey area of discretion. \n\nEither way, this is predictably outrageous, morally if nothing else. But many fellow liberals seem to think Biden should act/sue over this violation. I'm not really sure I agree that there is a case. It's more like the opposite of a violation. They *stopped allowing* violation at a strategic moment of harm. It's not really the same thing. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's just absurd that any state would have a deadline before the end of August, even if they usually waive it, and yes I'm levelling that as much at Washington as Ohio. If a state pushed back from the first time there was an August convention they'd have an argument, but none did and it's been 75 years, so any change now is purely partisan bullshit.\n\nOne nitpick: we don't directly vote for the president, we vote for a slate of electors. The state party would already know who they're using for electors, so the argument should be if Biden's name appears, not if there's a Democratic slate on the ballot. I can't tell if that's the real argument or not.\n\nI hope somebody blinks and Biden is on the ballot.",

It's a very different thing, though, to keep the sitting president off the ballot than to keep some random candidate.  The constitutionality of these restrictions is dubious, and a court would be highly inclined to find a way to get Biden on the ballot whereas courts are rather quiescent when it comes to Joe Exotic's inability to get on the ballot.\n\nBut... if they do that, they end up setting a precedent that makes it much easier for third party candidates in the future.  And that is very much not something they want do, so I think that either some kind of creative arrangement will get worked out, or Biden will just use this as a talking point on his stump speech about unfairness but not raise a serious challenge given that if he manages to win Ohio, he's already won in a landslide.",
