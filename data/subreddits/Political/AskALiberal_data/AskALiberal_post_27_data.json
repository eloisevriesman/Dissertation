I think we're way beyond the point of questionable messaging poisoning his brand. \n\nThe only hope to really dissuade some of the centrists from voting for him is if he gets convicted for a fairly straightforward offense and serves some sort of sentence. Campaign finance violations won't be enough since people have made it clear that they don't care about that when it comes to Trump. Extortion won't be enough because \"he didn't literally say quid pro quo\" was enough to dismiss it in the past as a \"sham\" trial. \n\nCampaign wise, our only hope is to sell Biden more. Unfortunately, many people have nothing to say beyond bashing Trump and anyone who doesn't vote against him. We've had 7 years of bashing Trump, and we're in what's looking like another close election. If that strategy worked, it would have by now.",

At the end of the day, it doesn't matter because charging Trump isn't something a plotical campaign can accomplish. The time for democrats to make sure the right people for the job are in offices and positions of power is long past \n\nRight now, all they can do is send messages to voters and enact policy. Policy wise, it should be clear as day the the current iteration of the republican party isn't responsible enough to govern, but low info voters and non-voters don't follow that. \n\nMessaging wise, I don't think most liberals and the DNC have been doing a very good job of building inroads with dissatisfied constituents and encouraging people to vote for Biden. They seem to have forgotten that a large plurality of Americans don't vote and simply yelling at them over and over again, \"this guy's sucks!\" doesn't mean their guy gets votes. It just means fewer people will vote, which benefits conservatives.",

I don't even remember, it's weird if someone explains it and there is some clear messaging.\n\nAll this to say.  idk what's going on with the staffers.

And the Democratic party, including users here, responded to that ruling by delegitimizing the ruling with a ridiculous conspiracy theory that implicates even the three liberal justices - another totalitarian behavior, btw.\n\n> The felony charges are well documented, and if he is convicted by a jury, then the process has been followed.\n\nThe jury is 87% composed of people who voted against him. And we all know that even if they find him guilty, the charges won't stick on appeal. So it's nothing more than election interference.\n\n> The fact that this keeps happening shows that somebody associated with Trump is promoting Nazi ideas.\n\nThere you go again - it wasn't from the Nazi period. And even if that's true, who the heck cares about *associations* compared to unconstitutional ballot bans? Assuming you don't disagree with the SCOTUS ruling, do you understand what it means? It means that the SCOTUS was literally **the only thing** that stopped the Dems from unconstitutionally canceling the election this year. How stupid do you folks think we independents are, that we would put *assocations* with some *staffer* on a higher level of importance than something like that?

I don't think it makes much sense to complain about someone reasoning it doesn't require a conviction, either. Compare it to the thirteenth amendment: \n\n>>Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime **whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction\n\nThe same people who passed the fourteenth amendment without a demand for a criminal convictiondemanded a criminal conviction in the thirteenth, they didn't just find it unnecessary to write the word \"convicted\" when they meant it.\n\nThe opinion in Trump v. Anderson, which is how Anderson v. Griswold went to the Supreme Court after some things I'm not knowledgeable on, doesn't claim the 14th amendment demands a criminal conviction or criminal charges, either - it only claims section 3 of the 14th amendment requires enacting legislation by Congress (if I understood it correctly). What can be criticized is the sentence before -\n\n>>Even if you don\u2019t consider trump an insurrectionist (lol) __there\u2019s no doubt he did that__\n\nYou need more than just yourself having no doubt.
