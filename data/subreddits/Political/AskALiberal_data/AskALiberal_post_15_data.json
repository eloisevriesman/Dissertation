The ideological claims about those theories fell apart around that same time, probably because the theories were being disproven.\n\nFor example, in 1990 an economist would tell you that the minimum wage is a price floor, and we should expect it to create inefficiencies like other price floors. In 2015 an economist would tell you that the had studied the actual data and proven the opposite, arguing that the theory needs to be updated as it was not borne out by experimentation. (The new theory is based on monopsony, but it is a young theory, still being questioned.)",

The Russian invasion of Ukraine spiked food prices across the world because of commodity pricing even effects markets that don't import ukrianian grains.

Stabilizing is what solving climate change means at bare minimum. I'm not sure why you seem to think differently.\n\n>If you produce enough grain internally (if the French ever learn to work, but that's another story ;) ), you can cut off Ukrainian/Russian import to counter them. It would effectively stop further inflation if stability is guaranteed through such a system.\n\nI'm sorry you are just incorrect. That's not how commodities like grain work. \n\nEspecially since France is one of the few states that is already producing enough food for itself and we already see how that doesn't protect against pricing being effected negatively by global affairs.\n\n>Try the same with the Saudi's. Cut them off if they're too busy filling their own pockets.\n\nThat doesnt change that their production still effect global commodity pricing and thus domestic pricing. The USA barely imports Saudi oil at al currently and we are still massively effected by Saudi production. \n\nNever mind that there are about hundred countries including the majority in Europe who simply can not possibly become oil and gas self sufficient because they have no access to sources, the same with grain. There is only so much farmland and so much food that can be produced on that land. France is already fine in that regard but most of Europe isn't. \n\n>The politician that does that, would end in a lake downstream, but the truth is that reducing these ties would help them\n\nConsidering the massive investments in climate change stabilization directly combats the oil demand that Saudi relies on that seems like an uninformed statement. The US and EU are directly combating their addiction to oil already but that seems to be against what you want given that a major effect of the Paris agreements you want out of.\n\n>If you guys elect Trump, we'll have no other option than to be independent.\n\nFrance is independent already.\n\n>It's not about a strained relationship, it's about the fact we need to be able to keep ourselves together even if the US lacks behind\n\nFrance can already do that...\n\nAgain you seem to care more about appearances than reality. France is independent and already only works with the USA to benefit itself.",

We've had an inflation of 12% (with food inflation going to 17%) thanks to the Ukrainian War, and I think we should prevent that.  \n\nIt's one of the reasons why I've gone from \"no government intervention\" to \"limited government intervention\".  We should promote our local industries over the international, and will indirectly help climate change. But that's where it ends, as I believe a country, as small as we are, can not make a real ecological difference. \n\n*Example given for an opinion:*\n\nWe should invest in nuclear energy (one of our biggest mistakes was to sell Electrabel to the French Suez thanks to Verhofstadt; The produced electricity should've been privatized but not to one, foreign company. That's subsidized monopoly and should be prevented at all costs.) and into research toward  nuclear fission. \n\nIt's not a vibe, it's the red thread that runs through my specific opinions: \n\nProtecting our (near Westphalian) regional - national as soon as possible - sovereignty, economic freedom limited by the morality as Burke would state it (Liberty does not exist in the absence of morality) and relative social conservatism.

They agree to not intervene until it directly affects them. There hasn't been any government that did not intervene somewhere in the economy. You may correct if I'm wrong.\n\nWe may be glad that the US has evolved away from the cheap, sweatshop-like labor. But that doesn't mean it's disappeared. It's been directly transported to other, even more corrupt countries and they'll directly argue for globalisation and neoliberalism to profit and benefit from it. Classic \"Not in sight, not in mind\". It's unsettling, but truth often is. There's only one disadvantage. The countries that we used in the past are now emancipating and improving their social economic situations, to the disgust of the multinationals who'll lobby against protectionism and finance local conflicts. \n\nGovernment regulation has killed off the industry in Detroit, but it increased the wages and it moved the production line out of the VS and toward other countries. Have we truly solved the issue? *Can* we solve this by regulation or by deregulation? Or are we just handing out the economical \"soft power\" we once had?\n\nYoung people are looking into communism because it formulates an easy answer: \n\nAn international revolution in which the Workers will take the power from the Bourgeoisie and establish a classless and truly \"equal\" society under a proletarian, global dictatorship. Sounds easy right? \"Revolution\", that means we can act now by any means necessary? Isn't that what young people want, fast change leading to a \"utopia\" that will realistically prove to increase instability and lead to many thousands of deaths?",

If one country produces all of our microchips, we would be highly disincentivized from going to war with that country because we'd be screwing ourselves over.  If we're totally self-sufficient, all of a sudden war looks much more doable.\n\nObviously it's a lot more complex and there are tons more variables but you get my point.  Being reliant upon each other can be very good for creating lasting peace.",

I've never once seen a conservative change their position on a policy until it negatively affects them personally. I've met more than a few people who became pro-choice after their loved one required an abortion, pro-social safety net programs when they lost their job and/or got injured, pro-universal health care when they went bankrupt due to medical debt, etc, Gay marriage and LGBT rights are the best example here than we all saw play out before our eyes over the past 2 decades. \n\nFWIW, I don't think people on the left are all that flexible either. I've found they usually have a better thought out reason for their position though. In the cases where they don't (usually a purely emotion based opinion), they're open to alternative solutions than the one they hold in their head so long as the same ends are met. \n\nLike I said though, my geographic location probably heavily influences these dynamics. To be a liberal in Indiana is to willfully choose to other yourself from your community, so we have usually thought through our positions and hold them out of principle. Most conservatives I know hold those positions because it's just how they were raised so why question it",

In the 1990's, Republicans proposed the individual mandate as a way to prevent free riders from mooching off our healthcare system. The idea was generally well-received among Republicans and even became a feature of Republican healthcare reform in Massachusetts. Fast forward to the 2000's, and Obama proposed the same individual mandate, but he pitched it as a way to help vulnerable people gain access to healthcare, and the individual mandate suddenly became a communist takeover of healthcare. \n\nMy takeaway from this was that the best way to get conservatives to support a policy is to focus on how the policy punishes bad people or gets government out of the way of good people, while the best way to get liberal support is to focus on how the policy helps vulnerable people.",

I can tell this is based on Belgium, which I am not well versed on (German).

The presumption many leftwingers have, particular the metropolitan types, is that if they see a food item on the menu, they should pronounce it like a native might. However, they never expect the same from anyone else, or have a lower opinion of them. If they see a name that's new to them but cultural, they want to pronounce it right. They would never correct anyone on the pronunciation of their name. Americans cringe at being American and the culture we have when we step away from our keyboards but it's just as valid as any other, but they pridefully expect Americans to be these superior people while expecting nothing of anyone else, because they secretly don't think they're capable.\n\nI even see it with politics. Many on the left don't see borders. In our country, we should already accept every path of sexuality that exists. But outside our borders? Things are bad to varying degrees, but intolerance is just accepted as part of culture still - which implies they see others as more savage-like. They just aren't honest about it.",

Now about 54% of those deaths were suicides, which is about 25,000, so 23,000 murders. And if we assume that each murder was committed by one person that was counted in that 80 million you get 0.0002875 percent of gun owners committing a murder. And that number is assuming each murder was committed by one person who legally owns a gun. A good chunk were likely committed with illegal firearms from the black market. \n\nSo statistically banning guns totally doesn\u2019t make sense with the math, because the vast majority of gun owners don\u2019t and won\u2019t shoot or kill anyone.",

If I\u2019m talking to say a local business owner or stock broker or something similar I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to convince them. They\u2019re following their material interest by voting for trump since he supports deglobalization which would help small to mid sized national firms and her gets them lower taxes. \nBlue collar conservatives I think can be convinced if the conversation is put in simple populist terms of elites vs the people. Just use Trumps strategy but the enemy is the rich more broadly rather than the rich who they just personally dislike. Frame the struggle of urban Black people, Latino farm laborers, and poor rural whites as the same problem of deindustrialization and mass corporate power.",

I consider these both to be leftist positions in principle but paper abortion is mostly opposed by people on the left using literally identical arguments that right-wingers use in opposition to abortion.  So I use arguments against them in support of paper abortion rights that I usually use against right-wingers in support of abortion rights.  The arguments I have with left-wingers on paper abortion are literally indistinguishable from the arguments I have with right-wingers on abortion, with each of them being in favor of the state forcing parenthood on one group because \"they shouldn't have had sex if they weren't willing to become a parent\" and me opposing the state forcing parenthood on anyone.",

I\u2019m looking at you Beto O\u2019Rourke. \n\nLook I get it, I get upset anytime I hear about a mass shooting, especially at schools. I think a lot of this fear from my fellow leftists comes from lack of education and experience with weapons. There\u2019s a lot of focus on the AR-15 but none on the other guns such as a Ruger Mini-14 mainly because it looks scary. They literally do the same exact thing and shoot the same caliber.\n\nShooting and hunting can be fun hobbies. If you\u2019re not into that, cool. But making those specific weapons, certain types of weapons, or all weapons illegal will do nothing. It\u2019ll just bring the prices up on a black market. People will still get them. For the record, I support background checks. But this will turn into nothing but something akin to the war on drugs. Otherwise law abiding gun owners will become criminals and fill our prison system even more. You think the prison industrial complex is bad now? It can get worse. \n\nHere\u2019s the other thing y\u2019all really need to hear. The right, especially of the MAGA variety, fucking hates us. They hate our values, they want a Christi-fascist nation, they daydream about murdering us. Now I don\u2019t necessarily think there will be a civil war (though it\u2019s certainly a possibility and would happen slowly), but I do see something similar to The Troubles on the horizon. Do you want the right to have all the weapons? If you don\u2019t want to get a gun, don\u2019t. But do you really want to depend on the police to protect you? Have you learned nothing from Uvalde? And more than likely they\u2019re not on your side. That being said, as a first responder, I do work closely with the police, there are some of us among them. Learn first aid, learn how and where to store them, learn how to use them. \n\nLike it or not, guns are a part of American culture. There are more guns than people in this nation. They\u2019re not going anywhere except underground if the worst happens. We\u2019re collectively stepping on our dicks by not embracing them or refusing to live with their existence.",
