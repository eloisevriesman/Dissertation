I am eager to listen to some left-leaning commentators, and am wondering who this sub would recommend. \n\nI have lots of time at work to listen to radio / podcast content. For reference, in the past I have listened to Ben Shapiro, and enjoy his format.  \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because their target demographic is to the left of progressive, their stances on things like Palestine, police, and such may be a turn off but I would guess you're likely to agree both on the principles (small government, non-hierarchical organizing, charity, collaboration, community preparedness, etc.) and on the issues they raise (people dying at the border, suppression of free speech, climate change, and so on.)",

Maybe start with some of his interviews with right wing people. Since you are on the right maybe subscribe to the main Bulwark podcast and get Never Trump voices. Though the host Tim Miller also has left wing people on. Jamelle Bouie and Paul Krugman are good at the Times. Clare Malone at The New Yorker is excellent. Matt Yglesias is behind a paywall now but he's good.\n\nI would suggest the left leaning writers for The Atlantic. The right leaning ones at there as well.

Me saying that Destiny spent a week reading Wikipedia was a figurative statement. I dont believe he literally spent a week reading Wikipedia. Obviously my statement was about his lack of actual background knowledge.\n\nAnd so, sure, rhetorically....you got me. Congratulations. But as a matter of substance, you achieved absolutely nothing except forcing me to clarify a statement which didn't actually need clarification. But for a \"debate bro\" this is exactly what matters.\n\nI never stated anything about advanced degrees. No, I don't believe that you must hold an advanced degree to debate. However, especially in the humanities you need to have a similar amount of background knowledge and at least a reasonable agreement on the facts in order to have a meaningful debate.\n\nFor example,  my degree is in history. I cant have a debate about a chronology of events with someone who doesn't acknowledge that radio carbon dating is a reliable means to provide dates to something. In stead of debating the topic we want, we would need to settle radio carbon dating first. If we don't agree on the basic facts underlying the debate, then we are having a different conversation entirely.\n\nThis is what Destiny did (and often does) in that \"debate\". Sure, it makes him seem like he has a counter argument, but it really is just obstruction, not a counter argument.\n\nFinkelstein's views on the Houthis is absolutely irrelevant to the facts about a debate about Israel.\n\nI am always happy to change my mind, but what you presented doesn't do it. Whenever that happens, I always try and give a reasonable and respectful reason why I didn't change my mind.",

If we\u2019re operating under your framework, we should be able to point out where he clearly doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s talking about. He debated one of the far-right Zionist members of Israelis government about how the expansion of West Bank settlements is preventing peace and he supports a 2 state solution. I don\u2019t understand how someone with so little knowledge can be having these high level debates and not be easily shown he\u2019s factually incorrect on fundamental positions.\u00a0\n\nI have my biases, I admit, but I was open to hearing what Norman Finkelstein had to say that would lead to a better understanding of the conflict and how it may be resolved. What was his approach to talking about those issues? He pulled out individual quotes from Benny Morris\u2019 books to attack him over (so much that the moderator had to tell him to stop) when he had that author right there that could explain the context. If he has spent his whole life to the I/P conflict, I would expect he would be able to properly educate Destiny on how he was factually incorrect. Instead, he spent the whole debate slinging insults and calling him different names.\u00a0\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Fls1z4e4nvo&t=136s&pp=ygUXbm9ybWFuIGZpbmtlbHN0ZWluIGxleCA%3D\n\n>Finkelstein's views on the Houthis is absolutely irrelevant to the facts about a debate about Israel.\n\nIt\u2019s relevant when he appeals to international law. Is there not a glaring contradiction when you claim Israel is breaking international law and we should respect the rules/laws in place yet his position is that it the Houthis breaking international law is acceptable? \u00a0\n\nI think it\u2019s fine not to like him or prefer scholars instead. The issue is when people only trust or listen to scholars who ideologically agree with them, ignoring contradictory facts.\u00a0",

            "body": "Looking at your flair, you may enjoy [Breaking Points](https://www.youtube.com/@breakingpoints). It's my go-to for non-MSM analysis. The comment section and reddit sub trend significantly right but the hosts themselves span the political spectrum. They all agree on hating MSM though.\n\nFor more strictly liberal and less serious analysis I would suggest [Secular Talk](https://www.youtube.com/@SecularTalk). I say less serious because he's more casual, but he covers everything from serious topics to nonsense that's just fun.\n\n[The Majority Report](https://www.youtube.com/@TheMajorityReport) is also a really good one for liberal analysis. Unlike Breaking Points their opinions are strictly liberal, but they're also more professional than Kyle over at Secular Talk.\n\nI have others that I follow but I only really watch them when the link is interesting. I usually catch everything the above puts out on youtube though. Also, note that I don't pay for any subscriptions or premium content\n\nI should also highlight Morning Joe over on MSNBC. I know he's a conservative and it's a mainstream morning show, but it is THE source for knowing where the Biden administration is at politically. Similar to how Trump watched Fox and Friends daily, Biden watches Morning Joe and according to reporting, speaks with the hosts on the phone fairly regularly. They're not nearly as honest about the facts as the people on youtube, but you know when you're watching that this is where the Biden team's head is at. I guess I could just watch the daily press briefing and get the same, but I don't hate myself that badly",
