Both could/can be pardoned by the president. \n\nThen, you have him falsifying his business documents which is handled at a state level and him being charged for trying to overturn elections in Georgia. One is handled in New York, the other in Georgia. Normally, you may correct me if I'm wrong, you'd suspect that Trump as president could postpone the business documents or pull it up to the SCOTUS. If the same goes for the case in Georgia, you'll see him run away without even a scar. \n\nIt's ironic, but I would place my bets on him never being injailed or even convicted.\n\n>But the point is that abuse of the pardoning system (which Trump already did by selling pardon before he left office) is not good enough reason to dismantle the whole idea of what a pardon is on a fundemntal level\n\nI understand the concept of a \"pardon\", but I do not see a realistic implementation of it. Simply put: For every case in which it should've been used (e.g. Carter pardoning draft evaders), there will be 10 in which it shouldn't (e.g. Ford pardoning Nixon). It's one of those things you need a people who believe in the fragility and the necessity of the democratic checks and balances for. \n\nJust look up all the pardons in the past, how many should've taken place? How many are presidents acting out of self-interest instead of fighting injustice?",

I understand however that part of being in a society is having to deal with people that you disagree with and do not like, and that it's even possible those people might actually even be correct every once in a while making you better off than if they were not also part of society.\n\nEvery once in a while however something happens which steps outside of that general dynamic into a thing that everyone in society should be in agreement is unquestionably unacceptable.  January 6th was one such event, the pardoning of Daniel Perry is another.\n\nI checked askconservatives for a question about this and was disappointed in what I saw.  To be fair most of the people were at least hemming and hawing about their position rather and the few who were openly celebrating it were down voted (though that may have been by non-conservatives), but no one just acknowledged this is an absolute miscarriage of justice for clearly partisan reasons.",
