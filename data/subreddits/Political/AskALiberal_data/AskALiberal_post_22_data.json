Book bans in school libraries and curriculum are often based on parents wanting to prevent their children from accessing certain information because the parents think they should have the right to dictate what information their kids get.  Parents are able to deny their children life-saving vaccines and other potential treatments for things like gender dysphoria.\n\nTruly the next battle after LGBT rights, a battle which has already started, will be the battle for children's rights not to effectively be the property of their parents.

Anything that makes the shooting make the news more fuels the next shooter, so maybe yes, in order to save the lives of children. Any rights violation is allowed as long as it's to save the children, right? \n\n>Our attitude toward guns wasn\u2019t the same back then as it is now.\n\nIt's changed quite a bit. For example, you've moved to wanting to ban the scary looking rifles. Back in the 1960s much of the gun control that existed was often in reaction to black people owning and carrying guns (such as the Black Panthers). \n\n>Back then there wasn\u2019t this militant push to expand gun rights and push them into as many public spaces as possible.\u00a0\n\nBack then the gun control people weren't pushing so hard. What you see as a \"militant push\" is a reaction to a strong effort to encroach on the rights of the people. It isn't a coincidence that the same decade the Sixth Circuit finalized the new \"collective right\" theory that let the government violate the right as much as it wanted is the decade that the push against gun control really cranked up. \n\n>I have long said that instead of changing the laws, we need to change the culture and do to guns what we did to cigarettes and drunk driving.\n\nWhat culture? Mine is safe and responsible shooting with any gun I choose, and safe and responsible carry if I want. Why would I want to change that?",

Most people working the types of jobs you're referring to can't afford any of that. And if they're not practicing with weapon, they shouldn't own it, since they can't safely hit what they're aiming for and not shoot bystanders instead.  \n\nThe driver license issue definitely needs to be fixed because having a government issued ID is essential for so many basic services.  The fees for a non-driving ID are not cost prohibitive, and people do have the option to learn to drive from friends & family so that can be done at lower cost. I know one area that has each DMV office open 4 days / week for 10 hours/day, and the different locations take turns being open on Saturdays. Between the evening and weekend hours, it's much more accessible.  I realize that rural areas with a single office per county can't do exactly that system, but being open one Saturday and one weekday evening per month would be do-able and help tremendously.",

This is especially true since you add \"unknown\" in there, nice try. Most victims know their attackers. This is especially common since most criminals know the other criminals, so they end up knowing those criminals who shoot them. Quite often one of these inter-criminal shootings is due to perceived or real insult, so of course the victim knows the shooter. \n\nBut we don't violate rights based on statistics.

One example is airlines. If they all went bankrupt, we'd be fucked, so we've been forced to bail them out over an over. Well, maybe give an industry one free bailout but with the stipulation that if they fail again they will be nationalized.\n\nEdit: As I understand it, the drug shortages have something to do with the fact that it's not profitable to produce them at the moment.

You don't have to make speeding physically impossible, you can accomplish the goal by simply dissuading it by design. Make the roads narrower, put more stuff (like trees or buildings) on the side of the road with minimal setback, get some tree cover (or other structures, like walkways between buildings) hanging over the road. Do that, and people will *naturally* slow down, despite there technically being nothing stopping them from still blazing down the street at high speed.

Or, better idea, you can keep voting\u2026 as long as you take and pass a competency exam before every election. For that matter, people of all ages should have to take a some form of IQ test every 5 years to be allowed to vote, and also a test proving competency in things like government and basic economics. And as long as you keep passing, voting is mandatory. \n\nI think the cutoff for running for office should be 60. Too many out of touch dinosaurs in office making laws about things they don\u2019t understand because they stopped trying to keep up with the times. And it goes without saying that running for office should also require IQ and competency tests. \n\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t call this authoritarian, but since we are on the topic of politics\u2026 I don\u2019t think politicians should be allowed to change their political affiliations while in office. If you were elected as a Democrat/Republican, then that is what you should have to remain while you were in office. (And your voting record on bills should reflect it.) If you want to change it after term and run again, fine. But if people voted for you, expecting you to align with a certain set of ideals, you should have to uphold that. If you decide to change your designation while in office, you should immediately be replaced by someone of whatever party you originally claimed to be a part of, until a new election can be held.",
