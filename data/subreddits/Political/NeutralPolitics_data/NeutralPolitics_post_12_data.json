Throughout its history, North Korea has pursued the understandable goal of national food security through an economically irrational policy of self-sufficiency.\n\n> inauspicious natural conditions, reliance on imported inputs such as oil used as a feedstock to produce fertilizer domestically, fertilizer imported directly from China, or donated by South Korea\n\n>leaving the system vulnerable to disruptions to input supply emanating from global market conditions and diplomatic conflicts, in addition to the vicissitudes of weather\n\nTLDR:\n\n1. inauspicious conditions make it hard to grow food\n\n2. The regime is incompetent and bad at making friends \n\n3. And they\u2019re a low priority for foreign aid for a variety of reasons. \n\nAll of which sucks for the locals. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667111522000263",

            "body": "The best answer is \"yes\"?\n\nWhile we cannot know if the Kim regime actively decides to starve certain people or groups and feed others or if the process of food allocation is more emergent from an opaque political process, it is clear that the Kim regime could acquire more food for its people of it chose to.  North Korea is not a case of a nation impoverished purely because of it is cut off from tlmost of the rest of the world.\n\nLet's begin with North Korea's - I'll abbreviate the countrybto DPRK - DPRK's military spending.  The CIA Fact Book published, for 2021, a [list of countries by estimated military spending](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2021/field/military-expenditures/) as a percentage of GDP.   The DPRK est8mate is 20%-30%.  The same estimate for South Korea (hereafter, ROK) is 2.64%, for the USA 3.73%, China 1.7%, Iran 2.1%, India 2.6%.  The [NATO alliance guideline](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm) for defence spending is 2%.  This is to show the DPRK is an extreme outlier in terms of its resource allocation priorities.\n\nAside from GPD estimates, the DPRK maintains essentially modern [nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-missile-tests-military-capabilities) while it [lacks night lighting for its civilization population](https://www.38north.org/2023/04/a-fresh-look-at-north-korea-at-night/).\n\nLogically, if the DPRK economy refocused away from defense to either food production or anything tradeable, there would be more resources available to either eat or trade for food.  Of course, DPRK can't trade very much because they are under [heavy international sanctions](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/north-korea-sanctions-un-nuclear-weapons), but those sanctions are in place, at least formally, because of their excessive military and the threat that they pose to nearby ROK and Japan.  Note that the sanctions regime is international and includes actions by the UN Security Council (see previous source), which required the acquiescence of comparatively DPRK-friendly Russia and China, thiugh the DPRK can likely still trade extensively with Russia and China and so has access to markets and food imports that way.\n\nOf course, the Kim regime sees the excessive spending on advanced weapons as necessary to ensure its survival, which is sort of true, because if they didn't have weapons ready to level Seoul but continued to operate as they do, then the US, ROK and Japan would love nothing more than to topple the Kim regime.  On the other hand, if the DPRK reduced its weapons portfolio and operated like a more normal country, its existence might be more tolerable to the rest of the world, but the Mr. kim wouldn't be running the DPRK the way he likes.  So, is the DPRK starving because sanctions?  Not exactly, but the regime's spending policy causes the poverty and sanctions while the spending policy is to some extent reactive to DPRK's conflict with the rest of the world.",

It is likely a combination of a lack of resources, despite the up tick in imports and a belief that the proletariate are there for the enrichment of the ruling class . Combined with the ruling party's need to appear (both internally and externally), affluent and well nourished. It would be similar to how many oligarchys in the past have opperated. When times are tough and as food becomes scarce, the people with the power hoard what is available and let the populace suffer the consequences.",

NK needed oil for what little factories and farming equipment they had. but they couldn\u2019t get it from Russia anymore. the [US blocked](https://books.google.com/books/about/Immovable_Object.html?id=7_r_DwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description) oil from coming into the country. without oil they could only rely on farming by hand and their factories were basically shut down. \n\nso they were bombed by the US, denied oil, livestock useless. they couldn\u2019t manufacture much without oil, they couldn\u2019t farm much without oil or livestock. then came the natural disasters.\n\nanother thing is that they would not ask for help much. Jimmy Carter said himself that the US did everything they could to ruin the economy of the [north](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTS3XR3z49o) (kinda iffy source, that\u2019s my bad). there\u2019s a lot of factors! i just wanted to add some that i didn\u2019t see here",
