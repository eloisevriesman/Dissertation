That makes legislation quite difficult to pass in a divided government. On the other hand, enacted legislation is the stongest form of policy change, because it cannot be easily reversed, countered or retracted.\n\nBecause it's difficult to pass legislation, Presidents use other methods, such as passing [executive orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order) (compiled [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders)) and appointing people to executive branch agencies who will enact [administrative rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_administrative_law) in alignment with administration goals. But sometimes, people who staff those agencies will carry over between admininstrations, so who do you credit the changes to?\n\nAnother way a President can affect policy is via the judicial branch. The adminstration, through the office of the [Solicitor General,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States) can sue to challenge the legality of existing rules or to defend rules it has enacted that have been challenged.\n\nThe point is, the US has a complex form of government and a deliberate separation of powers, so consolidating all the information about the policy moves of a particular administration into a single page or site isn't a simple matter. Nonetheless, it sounds like a worthwhile project.\n\nIn the meantime, there's [a section of this subreddit's wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/frequenttopics#wiki_u.s._presidential_administrations_so_far) that links to annual discussions of each administration's policy moves.",
