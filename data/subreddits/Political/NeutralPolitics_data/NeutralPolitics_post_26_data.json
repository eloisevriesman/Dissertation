            "body": "[Here is an article after 90 days of no cash bail policy in Illinois](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/12/29/24018920/illinois-first-state-to-eliminate-cash-bail-how-it-is-working)\n\nSome highlights from the article:  \n\nIllinois\u2019 historic pretrial reform has largely passed its first test, with no major scandals and no immediate impact on crime trends. Implementation has been mostly smooth as well, although uneven.\n\nIn Cook County, the change was supported by leaders and was an extension of reforms already in place. But officials in smaller downstate counties have been stretched thin by the requirements of the new system.\n\nThree months is not enough time to determine the impact the new system is having on crime rates, but he and his team are hitting the road soon to see how the law is playing out throughout the state.\n\nOne thing they have seen already, though, is the elimination of bail has driven down jail populations across Illinois. The amount of that decrease in jail population varies by the size of the county.\n\nIn some of the smaller, more rural jails, where historically people might have been held for offenses that are not detainable, the decreases in the jail populations have been larger than in some of the larger jails, where the majority of people held in jail are those charged with more serious offenses.\n\nSo, no spike in crime but a decrease in jail populations.",
