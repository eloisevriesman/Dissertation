There is no grand number to indicate success or failure in this area in the way that GDP, infant mortality rate, average lifespan, etc. are used as metrics to measure/compare other things like the economy and healthcare. There is no real reason to expect quality data in this field, as nobody is being paid enough to collect it properly, and there are no doubt pressures to mute or at the very least diminish the bad news.",
