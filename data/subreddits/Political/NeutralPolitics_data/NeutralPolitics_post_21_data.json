But while separation of Quebec from Canada was probably the optimal condition in context of 100 years ago, now it is difficult to say that it would be beneficial.  Likely the economic conditions would be worse but the sense of independence would improve.  But the disruption to the economic connections and social basis would be huge.  In Quebec, many of the northern indigenous people have no desire to separate, and much of the hydrological resources are within their lands.",

Separatist movements can arise when a group feels the state is exercising power over it without their consent. Under that paradigm, a government that wishes to deter separatism, and the potentially resultant balkanization, needs to ensure that the distinct groups under its control have a sense that they are consenting to be governed.\n\nWhen those groups have lost that sense, questions arise about whether there is a natural \"[right of secession.](https://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=annlsurvey)\" (PDF) In the US, a brutal war was fought over the [Confederate States'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America) claim they had a right to secede over slavery.\n\nFinally, [this paper](https://openyls.law.yale.edu/bitstream/handle/20.500.13051/6378/06_23YaleJIntlL1_1998_.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y) (PDF) argues that the current systems for determining who has a right to sovereignty are outmoded and outdated.",
