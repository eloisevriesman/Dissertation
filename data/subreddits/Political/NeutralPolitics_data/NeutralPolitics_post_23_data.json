            "body": "I absolutely don't have time to individually review the studies methodology in the Cornell link below - but I trust that the conclusions drawn are trustworthy.  \n\n\n>**Overview**  \nWe conducted a systematic literature review of all peer-reviewed articles published in English between 1991 and June 2017 that assess the effect of gender transition on transgender well-being. We identified 55 studies that consist of primary research on this topic, of which 51 (93%) found that gender transition improves the overall well-being of transgender people, while 4 (7%) report mixed or null findings. We found no studies concluding that gender transition causes overall harm. As an added resource, we separately include 17 additional studies that consist of literature reviews and practitioner guidelines.  \n**Bottom Line**  \nThis search found a robust international consensus in the peer-reviewed literature that gender transition, including medical treatments such as hormone therapy and surgeries, improves the overall well-being of transgender individuals. The literature also indicates that greater availability of medical and social support for gender transition contributes to better quality of life for those who identify as transgender.  \n\n\n[https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/)\n\n  \nI came out in 2004, and have known literally hundreds of transgender people throughout the last two decades. Every single person I have known has had their life greatly improved by access to care, and those who continued to suffer poor mental health outcomes either had additional mental health diagnoses or experienced stress not because of the treatment they received, but the challenges of navigating social stigma and concrete material challenges as a result of their identity.   \n\n\nI want trans people to have access to the best possible care, and believe in clear, actionable diagnostic criteria to help avoid people receiving treatment who won't benefit from it. If you survey the words and legislature of those opposed to trans care, it becomes clearly evident that their concerns aren't rooted in an effort to create or improve best practices in order to support good outcomes for trans healthcare, it is instead rooted in an ideological position that trans people literally do not and can not exist, negating the need for treatment entirely. For example:  \n\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/15/project-2025-policy-manifesto-lgbtq-rights](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/15/project-2025-policy-manifesto-lgbtq-rights)  \n\n\nIn the 920 page conservative policy document at the heart of the current legislative battle over access to trans healthcare \"Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise\":\n\n>Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, sets the tone with his introduction.  \nComplaining that in Biden\u2019s America \u201cchildren suffer the toxic normalisation of transgenderism with drag queens and pornography invading their school libraries\u201d, Roberts writes: \u201cPornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualisation of children \u2026 is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to first amendment protection.\u201d  \n\n\nNote that the authors do not speak of Transgender people, they speak only of \"Transgenderism\" or \"Transgender Ideology.\"   \n\n\nI came out before widespread access to trans healthcare was achieved, and largely had to find treatment by paying out of pocket. Despite the massive hardship that was normal for trans people seeking care at the time, that treatment that literally saved my life, and the lives of hundreds of people I have known for the last two decades.",

Lastly, in the last several years it's even been demonstrated that reputable journals have been fooled by already questionable studies like the dog rape culture study.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/arts/academic-journals-hoax.html",

What they did do was use Sweden's extensive medical records on all citizens to correlate gender incongruence with medical signs of outcomes from various treatments. Something you could never do in US states which is what OP was asking for. It is certainly a clever approach to compare historical medical data in this way. I agree that the findings seem rather positive, which is expected, however it also generated some criticism in the medical community regarding the statistical methods used. Specifically,\n\n* Concern 1: The analysis focused on mental health treatment utilization during one specific year (i.e., 2015) rather than during a longer follow-up period, such as before and after provision of gender-affirming treatment.\n* Concern 2: The study did not employ an adequate comparison group.\n* Concern 3: The study did not sufficiently highlight the elevated mental health care needs of transgender individuals seeking gender-affirming care during the perioperative period.\n\nHere is the actual study:\n\nhttps://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19010080\n\nAnd here is the the response by the authors:\n\nhttps://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.20050599",

There are no studies for the long-term effects of delaying the onset of an ordinary puberty using puberty blockers. That is the step that many of those European countries are on right now: interventions for gender distress using puberty blockers is still permitted IF PART OF A STUDY.\n\nUntil those studies are concluded, puberty blockers as a treatment is not recommended due to a lack of understanding of the potential long-term effects, and that is the most prudent and scientific approach to this situation.",

                                    "body": "> There are no studies for the long-term effects of delaying the onset of an ordinary puberty using puberty blockers.\n\nWhile this may be true there has been studies on the effects of delayed puberty in general. [Here's a literature review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8579478/) that's actually trying to make the case there may be more effects than are currently accepted (both beneficial and detrimental) although making no concrete conclusions. But the part most relevant to this conversation is:\n\n>delayed puberty is considered by many to be a benign developmental variant with no long-term consequences. Thus, the mainstay of treatment is an observational, \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d approach\n\nIt goes on to discuss how hormone treatments to kick start puberty are often done due to the psychological stress of not developing along with your peers which seems interesting considering the main use of hormone blockers is for much the same reason, psychological distress of not developing along with who you identify as your peers. \n\nObviously there is a wrinkle in that puberty blockers are not included in these studies but it seems reasonable to me that until we have solid evidence there are significant detrimental outcomes to delayed puberty AND that those detrimental outcomes outweigh the alternatives of untreated gender dysphoria that people and doctors should be able to make their own choices based on the evidence available to them.",

Sorry you're offended Invisible-Elephant, but #1, you're on NeutralPolitics, not worldnews, news, or politics, so you need to chill out with the personal insults. If you can't conduct yourself in a rational manner, then you should refrain from posting (and probably get off Reddit and the internet).\n\n# 2 What you just did is called an \"appeal to authority\" fallacy. The endorsement from those organizations, frankly, does not matter. The reality is that the studies. don't, exist (which is part of why you see European health organizations changing their stance).\n\nBasically all of their recommendations about the efficaciousness and safety of puberty blockers come from organizations like WPATH whose recommendations come from.. themselves. Those recommendations are NOT based on any robust scientific studies or consensus. It's not based off of the studies of prolific scientists in the field who have signed off. It's literally their own intentions and extrapolations based on the aforementioned studies on precocious puberty (which do exist, and do suggest that puberty blockers are safe, again, SPECIFICALLY to delay a PRECOCIOUS puberty until the onset of when an ordinary puberty would occur; NOT FOR DELAYING THE ONSET OF AN ORDINARY PUBERTY).\n\n>i genuinely don't care, because untreated trans kids commit self harm and suicide. i would rather a trans child live with weakened bones, or whatever side effect you fear, than die by suicide before they're old enough to drive, because they were told their humanity was less important than your subjective perception of a medical study's veracity.\n\nAgain, you're being anti-science, and are jumping to conclusions based totally on emotion, not understanding that there is a chance the interventions you are championing will lead to MORE self-harm, suicides, and misery for trans youth (and subsequently, their adult selves).\n\nI am not sure if you're aware, but there has been a report recently released that if you're ACTUALLY good-faith interested in this subject, you should definitely read: [https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/](https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/)\n\nIt actually details about the lack of evidence in many areas, and how we might identify, correct, and create effective treatments.\n\nYou don't realize this, but you could very well be the modern equivalent of people recommending lobotomies as treatments. Do you think that medical organizations should have done thorough studies on lobotomies before they were performed on 60,000 people? This could be something very similar; why are you against them doing the studies to find out?\n\nEdit: And you blocked me? Wow you are really immature. My response to your response below:\n\n\"Wow. I'm trying to give you thoughtful responses. \n\n>it's also three great reasons why i am not interested in hearing your opinion any further.\n\nYou do not have the intelligence nor disposition to even discuss this topic. I know you didn't even read my response.\n\nYou're literally being the transgender policy equivalent of a lobotomy supporter. I genuinely hope you feel remorse for the trans kids whose suffering you supported if it comes out that puberty blockers were, in fact, harmful treatments. But I suspect you don't actually care about this issue in the way that you say you do.\"",

Only to allow children to become adults or at least a fair bit more mature so as to make their own informed decisions. If a child thinks they are trans but are not, then that should become clear during the window that puberty blockers can provide.\n\nAnd those blockers are quite safe. Every medication has risks and side-effects and so must be weighed against the risks of doing nothing. Suicide rates among teens is already high, and for untreated trans kids is especially so. The benefits are clearly worth the risk of doing nothing.",
