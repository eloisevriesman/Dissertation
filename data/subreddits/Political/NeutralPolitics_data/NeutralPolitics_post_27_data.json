            "body": "The issue with democratic backsliding is that it's very subtle in a way that's hard to measure. I find Little & Meng very unconvincing because they focus on a very particular aspect of democracy. Most political scientists opt for one of two approaches:\n\n- Using subjective measures based on expert opinions like V-dem and Freedom House. While these are subject to some issues, they address these very well through intercoder reliability tests and usage of a wide range of indicators. The V-dem methodological report is worth a read here.\n\n- Using case studies. Qualitative research allows you to go really into depth in a particular case and allow you to highlight particular aspects of the backsliding process. A whole body of such studies that all point in the same direction might give some hints as that there's an ongoing trend.\n\nIn the social sciences, there are no such things as objective measures. Every measure has its advantages and disadvantages and these should be weighed carefully. The quantitative political science community generally prefers the V-dem measures. \n\nBiggest evidence for democratic backsliding trends are the yearly V-dem and Freedom House reports. There's a wide range of proposed explanations in the literature but no consensus on a single aspect (which hardly happens in the social sciences). A good starting point is [Waldner & Lust (2018)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628). They go over a large number of explanations. The cited by page of this paper on Google Scholar allows you to get a wider feeling of the literature.",

                            "body": "He's referring to mid-career Huntington, who developed a \"waves of democracy\" theory/framework. You can start from this Wikipedia page: [Waves of Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waves_of_democracy). It's pretty objectively true that waves of democratization happen in regional bursts which are often globally correlated. It's also true that democratic backsliding happens on similar patterns. But the regional patterns seem important. You're likely old enough to remember the anti-regime \"contagion\" of the Arab Spring. The fact that these things do seem able to jump also matters. I think there does seem to be anti-democractic contagion, too \u2014 look at the right wing leaders in Europe emulating and networking with each other. There are economic and political structures, but actors act within those structures, and these actors are influenced by others in the system.  \n\nHuntington also came up with the \"Clash of Civilizations\" theory which made predictions which has mostly not held up. It was one of several post-Cold War predictions. Fukuyama's \"the end of history\" thesis is another; Barber's \"McWorld vs. Jihad\" is another; and Fahreed Zakaria's \"Illiberal Democracy\" may be the most prescient. \n\nA lot of what we see does have the trappings of democracy. They have elections. There is a real chance that figures like Orban or Erdogan could in theory be voted out (figures like Putin and Chavez/Maduro, less so). Wikipedia is a decent place to begin here: [illiberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy). This doesn't explain the *why* illiberal democracies emerge, necessarily, but it does I think help just thinking how to classify them, and to think what are the element that make up actually-existing democracy. \n\nDon't read the late Huntington. His book *Who Are We* is all about how Latinos are destroying the fabric of American identity somehow. It's not a very rigorous book, in terms of actually engaging substantively with the extensive literature on American immigration and American identity.",

The safeguards to this are written into founding principles. One of them is that everybody needs to adhere to the law of the land, including the president. It is not 'I find illegal' - it actually is. \n\nSure, measures were supported because people support peace. \n\nBut that does not negate the fact that taking the power to just lock people up without due process (including enemies!) is, in the end, actually a threat to the will of the people being done.",

What do you mean, supporting a definition? *Words mean things.* I mean, I'm sure you can the meaning of the word 'democracy' up to a vote 'by the people' or something but that... doesn't actually change the meaning of the word 'democracy' into 'ruling by decree is now also democracy' (no matter what North Korea tries to tell you).\n\nDemocracy is a scale, sure - there are stronger and weaker democracies, and people argue about what is more or less democratic continuously. But at its core it means the power lies with the people. What these guys are doing is trying to get the power to be with them and theirs, only.\n\n>they vote for leaders who lead different than we expect it's anti democracy\n\nNo. Again, no. It is not 'lead different than we expect'. It is very specific. Like, Orban took steps to curtail freedom of speech *for everyone*, for example [by putting large fines on 'objectionable content'](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/media-law-outrage-hungary-s-orbanization-is-worrying-europe-a-736706.html) which is very vague and determined by a committee directed by Orban.\n\nSuch a measure is, by its very nature, undemocratic. - it takes the power to protest, discuss and engage in politics away from the people. These things are exactly why everyone is always so up in arms about freedom of speech. This is **actual, real censorship** - by a government and everything. Like, 100% that.\n\nMore importantly, Orban [has been governing by decree](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-investment-climate-statements/hungary/) - meaning, bypassing parliament - since november 2020 (first because covid, then the war, then...who knows) and it's [recently been extended to 2024](https://dailynewshungary.com/the-hungarian-government-has-extended-state-of-emergency-and-compulsary-action/). That's not 'different'. That is plain undemocratic. That is ignoring the rule of law and taking the power to do whatever he wants.\n\nYes, a majority of people can vote in a leader or leaders who then lead undemocratically - it happens all the time. The important question is: is it guaranteed the people can freely and openly campaign and elect someone else if they want to vote them out again?\n\nOh, also: republics have nothing to do with anything. I live in a constitutional monarchy with plenty checks and balances. Different thing altogether. It's the 'constitutional' that matters, not whose face is next to the flag.\n\n([Here you go with sources](https://theconversation.com/how-viktor-orban-degraded-hungarys-weak-democracy-109046), if you need some, so that answers your other question. Quite a few of them here, though they're... not hard to find.)",
