            "body": "The main issue you are going to run into is that most sources have a bias, and really you can counter that by reading a range of sources. \n\nThere are some that do a better job of it like: \n\n*Arabs and Jews in Ottoman Palestine: Two Worlds Collide* by Dowty, which is also more recently published. \n\nHe also has a book called *Israel/Palestine* however it was published in 2005 and updated in 2012 with the second edition. Mark Tessler's *A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict* with the second edition coming out in 2009.  \n\nA good book set on the history of Zionism is *The Origins of Zionism* and then, *Zionism: The Formative Years* both by David Vital.\n\nOther books I would suggest:\n\n* *Land and Power: The Zionist Resort to Force, 1881-1948* by Anita Shapira\n\n* *1948* by Benny Morris\n\n* *Righteous Victims* by Benny Morris\n\n* *A History of Palestine* by Kramer\n\n* *Palestine in Transformation* by Scholch\n\nYou can also look over the /r/AskHistorians reading list for it:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books/middleeast#wiki_israeli_and_palestinian_history",

It\u2019s PBS and as neutral as they come, and every single president is criticized. It\u2019s also a great background on Netanyahu from a historical context (his early days in politics, his rise to power, his campaign promises etc). Really provided the context needed to understand the conflict from a neutral source. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/6-vzy4tYfaI?si=tbDTNBEgAJl6kctw",

Hamas is bad, Netanyahu is actively doing a lot of child murder, and it seems like there\u2019s genuinely no good actors to root for. Maybe the Israeli citizens who are protesting for Netanyahus removal? Who will lead Palestinians to a peaceful future, can I root for them? \n\nThe only 2 things I sort of seem to know is that women and children should be allowed to flee Gaza and a ceasefire will lead the less child death. The kids man\u2026 13,000+ is so many\u2026 \n\n[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/s/VRuQLgG0qD) was a write up I did (with sources) on the college protests, but the first part of the history was my quick summary of the documentary. \n\nAnd [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/s/2kZ60uIoaG) is not my comment, but rather another really good one about why it\u2019s so difficult to pinpoint the \u201cwho started it\u201d argument. \n\nSorry I brought your day down but while it\u2019s depressing it\u2019s so good for understanding the US and Israeli relationship.",
