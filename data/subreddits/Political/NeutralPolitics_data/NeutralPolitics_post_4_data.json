                            "body": "I commented above, but I\u2019d suggest a book about those books. I personally enjoy reading the original material, but if you\u2019re looking for somewhere to start, it\u2019s probably better than you have a better idea of their context. \n\nSpecifically, read about social contract theory. The original US constitution was designed with a social contract in mind, but lots of thinkers had different ideas about what what the social contract was and meant for society. Once you\u2019ve got a good grasp on what they\u2019re talking about, you can start exploring the people that responded to Locke and Rousseau, like Marx, and understand their work in context.  \n\nFor example, and this is a way oversimplification that someone could probably nitpick to shreds (it\u2019s been a few years), Locke believed that an individual right to property was essential to the smooth functioning of society because property rights gave way to formal means of dispute resolution (rule of laws), rather than simply violence. Marx believed that accumulation of personal property was the cause of violence in many cases. \n\nThey both make some good points and it\u2019s worth reading, eventually. But don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew :) you\u2019ve got a lot of time to read political theory and philosophy. What is more important is fostering your ability to think critically; that doesn\u2019t mean being a devils advocate all the time, it just means that you should be thoughtful and intentional in your life. Take the world in and be a student of it. Don\u2019t take everything you read as the truth, and learn how to recognize bullshit. Philosophy wouldn\u2019t continue as a discipline if anyone had figured everything out. Socrates was wise because he knew that he did not know it all, and his greatest skill was demonstrating that the people who thought they did, did not.\n\nAlright, I rambled more than I thought. But I appreciate your question because my college discovery of political philosophy and the project of solving collective problems gave my life direction when it had none. You\u2019ve got a five year head start on me, I\u2019m jealous! Cheers.",

It's good for a high schooler's first step into socialist thought, but you're far from understanding socialism. Too many conservatives do a half-assed reading of the manifesto and think they understand socialism. Read Das Kapital by Marx and Engels if you want a more thorough understanding of socialism, it's the most important socialist book. Make sure you get a real copy, there's a lot of books on Amazon that advertise themselves as the full thing but aren't. Das Kapital is long as fuck (3 volumes, something like 1500+ pages if I remember correctly) and very dense, so it's not an easy read. Idk your reading level or current level of comprehension of philosophical and political thought, maybe save this for when you're a little older and more familiar with these topics OP",

Major entrance into the global markets in the '80s, in post-soviet nations during their redevelopment in the '90s, I'm finally appearing in the west in the forms of privatization, austerity measures, and tax cuts in the 2000s.\u00a0\n\n\nKlein documents 40 years of cases which show Friedman's practical methods for pushing through unpopular economic decision by preparing plans in advance for times of crises so that when a moment of political unrest or economic uncertainty arises, broad sweeping changes in economic policy can be rolled out with no delay. With case studies spanning decades and continents, it is a great introduction to history of economic uncertainty in the 21st century.\u00a0\n\n\nKlein is a progressive journalist aunt.

Writing for a wide audience, David Harvey, author of The New Imperialism and The Condition of Postmodernity, here tells the political-economic story of where neoliberalization came from and how it proliferated on the world stage. Through critical engagement with this history, he constructs a framework, not only for analyzing the political and economic dangers that now surround us, but also for assessing the prospects for the more socially just alternatives being advocated by many oppositional movements.",

It really helped me understand up to WW1\n\nWould also say to read sources like Karl marx actual book and Paine\u2019s The Rights of Man, as well as Lockes Two Treatise on Govt.  Also Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations.  Even Spark notes/ cliff notes on these would be helpful!\n\nAs for Russian History\u2026. Find  a text book called \u201c Russia and the Soviet Union\u201d - it\u2019s old but solid. Also for more modern history Pasternsks \u201cDr Zhivago\u201d, while a novel, provides context to the impact of WW1, and the actual Civil War that followed the revolution.  Then Solzhenitsyn\u2019s \u201cGulag Archipelago\u201d really nails the reality of the purges.  \n\nI am currently reading Scott\u2019s works on the French Revolution and Napoleon as well.  Scott was alive during that time, so it\u2019s an interesting perspective.   The Revolution in the US and France sort of started the fire of non king led nation states outside of England.",

Primary sources, Seems great. \n\nThe problem is, the list of documents notably excluded the Declarations of Causes for Secession of all 5 states that wrote them. \n\nWhy publish a book of comprehensive documents to better understand the civil war without the documents that explain the literal reasons given for the civil war? Well, because all 5 documents mention upholding slavery as a reason, if not the main reason, for seceding. One even mentions the states anger with northern states for exercising their own states rights to not return escaped slaves, completely disproving the idea that the civil war was \u201cabout\u201d states rights in the first place.  https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states\n\nIt\u2019s not always what\u2019s said, sometimes what is not said paints the clearest picture.",
