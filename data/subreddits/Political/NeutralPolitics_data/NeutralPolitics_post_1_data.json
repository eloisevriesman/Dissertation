            "body": "> the typical starting wage for fast food jobs in 2024 is about $13/hr\n\nIn the wake of the pandemic, there was a [dramatic labor shortage,](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/11/how-mcdonalds-and-wendys-are-dealing-with-fast-food-labor-shortages.html) causing fast food outlets specifically to have a hard time filling positions. That drove up the typical wages of those and similar jobs. \n\nIt's a supply and demand issue. It's not related to the statutory minimum. If there were a surplus of labor, you'd see those wages drop, especially in areas with low cost of living.\n\nSince that time, however, [unemployment has remained low](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm) and [labor constraints in food services have remained high,](https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-bulletin/labor-constraints-and-strong-demand-are-driving-robust-food-services-inflation/) providing support for the high wages.\n\n> is there anyone getting paid 7.25? If so who?\n\nYes. It's [mostly young people people working part time jobs.](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2022/home.htm)",

Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not seem to have a number for 2023 yet, [141,000 workers were paid exactly the federal minimum wage](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2022/home.htm). The source also notes that these people are primarily from DC, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Rhode Island.\n\n2) People against raising minimum wage [have varying arguments against raising it.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets-economy/090516/what-are-pros-and-cons-raising-minimum-wage.asp). The most prevalent one is \"workers currently making the minimum wage will lose their jobs if the minimum wage goes up, as their employers will no longer be able to hire them and the business will close. $7.25/hour>$0/hour, so we should keep the wage as is.\" The second most prevalent one (from what I've seen) is \"the states should decide their minimum wage. The federal minimum wage should be a low baseline, as states and regions within those states with very low cost-of-living may not require a higher minimum wage to live comfortably there.\"\n\n3) Unfortunately, this statistic seems to be pretty difficult to find. Wages aren't public information, and companies aren't incentivized to publicly say \"we're paying at or barely above minimum wage!\"\n\nAnecdotally, it is *possible* to live comfortably on minimum wage in some areas. When I was volunteering in West Virginia, I got paid the fedeal minimum wage as a stipend. My yearly income income ($13,502 after federal taxes) was well below the food stamp threshold (130% of the poverty line, or $19,578), so I qualified for food stamps. Due to living in rural West Virginia, my rent was also quite low; only $575 for a one-bedroom apartment. Other government assistance programs allowed me to get a free gym membership and free internet, meaning my monthly expenses were only around $650/month including rent, food, and entertainment. This gave me a surplus of $475/month.\n\nTL:DR Some areas of the country have a much lower cost of living. The federal minimum wage says \"even in those crazy low COL areas, you still have to pay $7.25/hour.\" As such, people can still make the federal minimum wage and have their basic neess met (although you probably have to get government assistance).\n\nNote that personally, I'm in favor of increasing the federal minimum wage. That said, I hope the above summary was neutral.",

For example, ignoring government assistance in that definiion would mean disabled people would have to make ~$1.4K/month more from their salary to have a \"livable wage,\" despite the fact that they already get that money. If we define livable wage as $15/hour, then it'd be insane to tell a disabled person \"taking a job paying less than $23.50 an hour is an unlivable wage for you.\"",

These are primarily hospitality/ recreational jobs being worked part time by people under the age of 25. With the majority of the workers at minimum wage receiving tips to supplement their income.\n\nIn table 2, We can see a larger number in the South, ( about double other regions), But those are disproportionately in the \"Below minimum wage\" category which means they're operating on the alternate minimum wage for tipped workers.\n\n  \nSo based on that, the only people reportedly making minimum wage are tipped staff largely. (Who may or may not be reporting their tips accurately to begin with and are not reflecting their actual income into the data)\n\n  \n2.

Universal mandated increased costs will always favor larger, wealthier, established entities. That also applies to states as well. Higher mandates leaves poorer states and regions completely reliant on outside investment and effectively turns poor regions of the country into \"internal colonies\" by regulating that only rich entities from wealthy areas to be able to afford the operating costs and just keep a region sucked dry of any actual investment.\n\nMinimum wage should have always been a state and local issue such that it could be tailor fit for local cost of living.\n\n  \nThere is also a chance that the data is poorly collected. Given the number of tipped staff at minimum wage, and the propensity of tips to be under reported, we could raise minimum wage and not actually have any real effect on the people you're trying to help. They'll just report the new higher minimum wage and keep under reporting any tips they receive.\n\n  \n3.

It was designed to prevent exploitation of people on the lowest rung of the employment ladder and it assumed they'd be living with family or in some other kind of communal situation.\n\nAs people get more experience, they work their way up the wage scale, eventually getting to the point where they can share an apartment with a roommate or two, but living alone has long been a luxury that only people making at least double the minimum wage could afford. (Note that this is different in rural communities, due to cultural norms and supply/demand issues, but in urban areas, that's how it has been.)\n\nIn 2009, when the minimum wage was raised to $7.25 per hour, a person working a 40-hour week would earn $290 before taxes, or about $1210 a month, assuming 50 weeks a year. \n\nSince you mentioned Pennsylvania, let's take a city like Pittsburgh as an example, which falls in the [middle of the cost-of-living range](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/region_rankings_current.jsp?region=021) for U.S. cities. A studio apartment there [cost $541 per month](https://www.rentdata.org/pittsburgh-pa-hud-metro-fmr-area/2009) in 2009, or 45% of income. In 2007, the minimum wage was set at $5.85, yielding a monthly full-time gross of about $975. A studio apartment in Pittsburgh [cost $570 per month then,](https://www.rentdata.org/pittsburgh-pa-hud-metro-fmr-area/2007) or 58% of income.\n\nClearly, rents are higher now, but the point is, nobody working a minimum wage job could afford even the smallest apartment back then. It's not a new phenomenon and it doesn't translate to a failure of the minimum wage law to serve its purpose.",

I argue setting the minimum wage to pay a livable wage can actually be a net negative to the poor, and we should directly give them welfare instead.\n\nIf we increase the minimum wage, two things happen. First, the pay of people making minimum increase, which is objectively good, and the number of jobs available to them decreases. This is because at the higher wage, it is simply not worth it to pay someone to do certain jobs because paying them would be a net loss. This is a reasonable statement right?\n\nAt some point the number of jobs lost is worse for the poor than the increase in pay. This means the optimal minimum wage that helps poor people the most is not nessicarily a living wage, and in fact the two are completely unrelated, so we shouldn't strive to set the minimum wage to a living wage but rather the one that helps the poor the most.\n\nInstead, we should give welfare directly to the poor to put their income to a higher level, because it gives them money directly without reducing their rates of employment.\n\nBasically, setting a high minimum wage can make people net worse off, because although those who find low pay jobs are better off, there are less jobs overall.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage#Debate_over_consequences",

                            "body": "There are some good points here. \n\nThe truth is, there's been [a lot of inflation](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2009?amount=7.25) since 2009, but the minimum wage hasn't been adjusted. According to a link in your first source, it was raised 17 times in the 50 years prior to that, which is a little more frequently than once every three years on average. So, the fact that we've gone 15 years without an adjustment is definitely unusual and it would make sense that fewer people are actually being paid that wage now.\n\nOne potential way to eliminate the tipped workers from the BLS numbers is to include only those who are making exactly the minimum, because [tipped workers](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped) are often the only ones allowed to be paid less over the course of a full year. It's not the most solid premise, but perhaps worth exploring.\n\n2010 was the first full year with the $7.25 minimum. The [BLS report for that year](https://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2010.htm) says:\n\n> 72.9 million American workers age 16 and over were paid at hourly rates, representing 58.8 percent of all wage and salary workers. Among those paid by the hour, 1.8 million earned exactly the prevailing Federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.\n\nThat comes out to 2.5% of all hourly workers.\n\nBy contrast, the [2022 BLS report](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2022/home.htm) says:\n\n> 78.7 million workers age 16 and older in the United States were paid at hourly rates, representing 55.6 percent of all wage and salary workers. Among those paid by the hour, 141,000 workers earned exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.\n\nThat's only 0.18% of all hourly workers, and the report itself says they're mostly not working full-time.\n\nI wouldn't call this conclusive evidence, but it certainly supports your hypothesis that not enough people are currently being paid the hourly minimum to imply that a moderate increase would have any effect on the broader economy.\n\nI still have my doubts about using fast food service work as a marker. I can think of a bunch of jobs that *should* pay lower than that, but I also wasn't able to find any job listings to prove the supposition.",

                                    "body": "So I looked closer. The 2022 BLS report (https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2022/home.htm) also says right at the top: \"The data are obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a national monthly survey of approximately 60,000 eligible households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Information on earnings is collected from one-fourth of the CPS sample each month. The CPS does not include questions on whether workers are covered by the minimum wage provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) or by individual state or local minimum wage laws. The estimates of workers paid at or below the federal minimum wage are based solely on the hourly wage they report, which does not include overtime pay, tips, or commissions.\"\n\nMy interpretation of that is people reporting the exact amount of $7.25 may still be making more in tips, and most probably are: \n\nBecause it also says : \"The industry with the highest percentage of workers earning hourly wages at or below the federal minimum wage in 2022 was leisure and hospitality (about 7 percent). About 3 in 5 of all workers paid at or below the federal minimum wage were employed in this industry, almost entirely in restaurants, bars, and other food services. (See table 5.)\"\n\nand\n\n\"Among major occupational groups, service occupations had the highest percentage of hourly paid workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage, at 4 percent. Nearly 3 out of 4 workers earning the minimum wage or less in 2022 were employed in service occupations, mostly in food preparation and serving-related jobs. For many of these workers, tips may supplement the hourly wages received. (See table 4.)\"\n\nThis all supports the tipped position theory. There may be a small amount of workers who are untipped in the food industry who make bare minimum--- cooks, fast food. But if you actually open up those tables you will see the other industries reporting at or below include education, retail, and manufacturing. Unclear what jobs that entails and why they would be below which requires exceptions to the law or illegal pay. The report suggests some survey respondents may be rounding down their wage.   \n\n\nStill  there is no evidence of $7.25 wages perusing 2024 job listings. In current inflationary conditions each year that goes by the wages get farther and farther from the legal minimums, so this 2022 is not even good data now. Mississippi is ranked as having the lowest cost of living (https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/least-expensive-states). And follows the federal minimum wage. So perusing entry level jobs on zip recruiter in MS what are the lowest paid jobs I can find?....Circle K gas station starting at $13.25. Travel center Cook 11.50. Dental Receptionist $12. Personal care attendent $9.75. Cricket Wireless 12.50. Murphy Gas station $9.25. Oh the winner appears to be Popeyes chicken starting at $8/hr. What they list and what people get hired at is an unknown. But another point there in support of fast food being the floor.",

Is that common? 2) was shoe salesman formerly a minimum wage job, or was it potentially more lucrative with large commissions? Historically what have been the entry level \"minimum wage\" jobs? 3)How has the livability of the minimum wage changed over time? (or more to my point, how has the livability of the realistic wage of the lowest wage jobs changed over time)?\n\nThis chart (https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/172eiap/median\\_national\\_home\\_price\\_relative\\_to\\_federal/) suggests home ownership was once much more feasible on a minimum wage, which would suggest that renting was also once much more affordable. \n\nHere is a graph with overall purchasing power (https://www.epi.org/blog/the-minimum-wage-has-lost-21-of-its-value-since-congress-last-raised-the-wage/) which has fallen. This is out of date and it would fall even more.  But as per my key point, it may not be a meaningful figure. \n\nThen the livability of the minimum wage might be better compared with the cost of a lower end apartment than median. HUD uses a number called the fair market rent which is the 40th percentile. (https://www.rentdata.org/lookup). In florida where I live now this site lists a studio at $1048 which seems realistic for a number that is supposed to represent below average. If I were to go out and get a $14/hr job (there are many, state minimum in florida is $12) that would be 44% of my income. Which is doable, but I would need to rent from an individual and not a property management company that checks your paystubs for the 3x amount. I think this is something that has gotten more difficult over time, the corporatization of housing has put up more barriers (personal perception over two decades).",

            "body": "Pt1: Fundamentals of Economics\n\nIn the introduction to economics (macroeconomics and microeconomics), we learned that the [Washington Consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus) was the basis for modern economic theory.\n\nDuring this, we learned a lot about how economics is firstly _extremely complicated_ with so many factors for which it is hard or impossible to account. But, the basic math and models tell us that by doing stuff like increasing the minimum wage mandated, we start to see employers hiring fewer employees and the opening of \"Black Market\" jobs (jobs that aren't reported to the government, think everything from when you hire the teenager down the street to be your babysitter and you pay in cash down to shady corporations hiring people abroad to do jobs but not telling the government). \n\nNow, as you can imagine, this has negative effects on society and the government. Less revenue for the government, fewer jobs for the individual. However, this obviously isn't the full story because, without any government intervention, you may start seeing employers exploiting workers. But if they aren't and people feel largely like their wage is fair, minimum wage doesn't need to be increased.\n\nSo! To make a long story short: Because the federal government doesn't feel like it would help or improve anything to increase the minimum wage. They only want to intervene when they need to.\n\nPt2: The Organization of America\n\nIn the US, we organize things differently than many of our contemporaries. This is for a variety of reasons, ranging from our origins to our size. The result is that federal laws and regulations have to be a good idea across the country for them to be a good idea. This is really where the federal minimum wage has problems. The US has _vastly_ different costs of living depending on location. A wage of $100,000/year could be enough to buy a house, raise a family and live comfortably. It could also be so little that you can barely afford rent and have to eat Ramen every night because that's all you can afford while you spiral deeper and deeper into debt as you struggle for even the basics. The difference is location. LA will be different than rural Nebraska. \n\nIf you make minimum wage, say, $15 an hour, this will be far too low for West Hollywood but far too high for rural Nebraska. So, the general thought process becomes... let's just let States figure this one out. So, what states have done is made it so their state minimum wage reflects the minimum cost of living in the state (in theory, in practice, it's hit or miss), then have specific counties or municipalities have a higher minimum wage. For example, California has a minimum wage of $16/hr. However, West Hollywood has a minimum wage of $19.08 (source: https://www.paycor.com/resource-center/articles/california-minimum-wage/)\nIn Washington, the minimum wage is $16.28, but Seattle has a minimum wage of $19.97 (source: https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/minimum-wage/) \n\nSo, in other words, another reason is that the US is so varied that it makes sense to do what the US was designed to do and have the States handle as much as you can let them, and then the federal government handles the rest.",

Yes, there are hotspots, but we have a half hour average commute because people are fully aware that they may need to commute a few counties over to make their budget work with the job they can get, so it is useful to look at it by metro area.\n\nhttps://livingwage.mit.edu/",

The psychologist side of me wonders what the incentives are , and the research side of me is annoyed people use the minimum wage as a relevant statistic when it doesn't seem that relevant.\u00a0",
