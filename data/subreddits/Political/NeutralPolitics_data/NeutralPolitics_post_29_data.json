For example, a single **strawberry robot harvester** has the potential to pick a 25-acre area in 3 days and replace 30 farm workers.\n\nhttps://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/resources/how-automation-transforming-farming-industry/\n\nI just quickly googled for a study and found this:\n\n>  In total, the system was able to harvest 87% of all detected **strawberries** with a success rate of 83% for all pluckable fruits. \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03947\n\nSo I don't think it'll nearly be as catastrophic as 30-40%. To clarify, I'm not saying this is wrong or right, just that a quick search on my end indicates that we might expect efficiencies of >90% for \"easy\" to harvest fruit and >80% for more difficult ones.\n\nAnd of course, I feel obligated to point out that if robots are cheaper than people and land isn't an issue, you could spend the saved money on growing more plants to make up for any losses due to damage from robots that would have been avoided by people and to provide a buffer during years of poor harvests...and so on and so forth until available farmland does become an issue.",
