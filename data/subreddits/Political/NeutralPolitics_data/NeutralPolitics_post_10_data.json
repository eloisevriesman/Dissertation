From that article:\n\n> Such divestment can be complicated when a university\u2019s financial relationship to a targeted company is not direct but through an investment in an index fund.\n\nIndeed, [index funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) are diversified, making them safe and extremely popular, but it would be possible for any well-educated investor to avoid them and make targeted investments instead. The issue comes up when any institution's investing guidelines mandate low risk investing with the highest possible yields. It's hard to beat index funds for that.\n\n> \u201cDivestment is a rallying cry that is nationally resonant,\u201d said Nick Wilson, a 20-year-old Cornell student involved in the protests. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our tuition dollars going to the research and development of weapons\u201d that may be used against Gazans.\n\nIs it tuition dollars or endowment dollars that are going towards these investments? My understanding is that tuition dollars get spent entirely on education. In a university like Harvard, tuition revenue doesn't even cover operating expenses and [the endowment has to make up the difference to the tune of 37%.](https://finance.harvard.edu/files/fad/files/fy23_harvard_financial_report.pdf) (PDF, page 6) It's less at Columbia, with [only 12% of the budget supported through the endowment,](https://www.columbia.edu/content/financial-overview) but even so, all the tuition dollars are spent on operating expenses. They're not going to investments.\n\n> the most consistent demand is that the college institution divest the endowments from Israeli companies and institutions\n\nMy understanding is that the demand for divestment is complicated by the fact that\n[38 states](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-bds-legislation) have [anti-BDS laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-BDS_laws#Anti-BDS_laws_in_the_United_States) on the books. The list includes not just states with Republican legislatures, but also Democratic strongholds like New York and California, where many of the protests are taking place. \n\nThese laws have passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, so reversing them would be a monumental task for the protesters. But without achieving that, university administrators are often barred from making any moves towards divestment, even if they wanted to. \n\nIn those cases, it's hard to see how the protesters' demands are reasonable or even well-informed, but perhaps I'm missing something. What do the protest groups say about cases where their demands of university administrators conflict with state law?",

                            "body": "> Is it tuition dollars, or endowment dollars that are going towards these investments? \n\nThe students are aware that the investments are part of the endowment and not taken from their tuition. Many universities acknowledge at the institutional level that their choice of investments ought to represent the values of the university as a place of learning populated by faculty and students, and have looked in the past to students to hear opinions on how to direct endowment funds. Some quotations from Brown University students' overview statement [Brown Divest Now](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3VLPCRi7qvMkdcWqj-2HPwR9C1Oq1uL/view):\n\n> [Brown's Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Practices] served to represent and articulate the Brown community\u2019s moral expectations when it comes to how our endowment is invested. (p.2)\n> \n> \u201c[Divestment] is a critically important and strong statement by the University community...\" (quotation from Brown President Ruth J. Simmons on a past decision to divest from Sudan in 2006; p.1)\n\nThe fundamental issue raised by the Brown protesters is that the university endowment's Advisory Committee already endorsed divestment in 2020. The current president rejected the committee report in 2021 and refused to bring it to the university corporation, which has been the cause of protests ever since. (p.37, footnote 9) A vote of 90% of graduate students and a supermajority of the student council have called on the corporation to implement the committee's decision. (p.22)\n\nFor Brown students, the objective of the encampment protest was simply to force the president and the corporation to agree to a vote. Last week, they reached such an agreement and dismantled their encampment. ([NPR report](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/01/1248403491/at-brown-university-protesters-and-administrators-reach-deal-to-end-encampment))\n\nI have no knowledge of the position of students in other states so can't comment on anti-BDS laws.",

(That\u2019s one of the [core tenets](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy) of the [Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org) line of thinking.)\n\nBut this brings up a host of secondary questions, including: what exactly defines a company that has ties to Israel? Is it any company that has a physical presence in the country? Agreements with the government? Customers in that country? (Does Google / Microsoft / Apple / other large American multinationals that do business in almost every country in the world count?)\n\nAnd honestly, an index fund won\u2019t have a major stake in any single company (that\u2019s kind of the point).

As a result, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a big chance that divestment would have a meaningful impact on the company in question. Divestment from said funds would largely be symbolic, which, sure, but it feels like a weird goal to use as your primary demand.\n\nI mean, if Columbia had 50% of their endowment planted in Raytheon stock, that would make sense.

On paper, it can be separated out into various inputs and outputs and trade certain money from one to the other. In practice, if an entity has a certain amount of money coming in (e.g., combined funds from tuition and endowment) and a certain amount of money going out, does it really make a difference which money comes from where?

In fact my sister asked me the other day why students are randomly supporting a terrorist group. \n\nSo real quick, the October 7 Hamas attack killed around 1,200 people and 253 people were taken hostage. This includes 764 civilians killed (36 children) while the remaining were Israeli military. \n\nhttps://tennesseelookout.com/2024/02/20/the-most-tragic-victims-in-the-israel-hamas-war-are-those-who-have-no-say-in-it/\n\nSince October 7th, Israel has killed 34,535 Palestinians and there may be an additional 10,000 under rubble. This includes more than 11,000 women and 13,800 children. \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2024/02/29/1234159514/gaza-death-toll-30000-palestinians-israel-hamas-war\n\nSo there is a huge mismatch between deaths of Israeli and Palestinians especially among women and children (36 Israeli children and 13,800 Palestinian children in 7 months, and counting) \n\nAdditionally, Gaza is surrounded by a wall and the two borders crossings are closed. Israel has 1 border and has closed it (because war) and Egypt is worried about Hamas among refugees sneaking into Egypt and moving the Palestine/Israel problem and turning it into an Egypt/Israel problem if Hamas attacks Israel from Egypt. \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/12/12/1218388766/egypt-israel-gaza-palestinians-hamas\n\nSo for now, the 2 million people in Gaza are stuck there. Women and children who would be refugees fleeing violence are instead part of the death count. \n\nKilling children is a war crime. The US gives Israel military aid which has people upset and I would argue is the root of the protests. \n\nColleges invest their money in the stock market including companies currently profiting by the US support of Israel in this war. Students hope that by pressuring colleges to remove stocks/investment in these companies (divesting), they can make profiting from the war unprofitable for companies as their stocks dip. Colleges have a lot of wealth and power, and students hope to twist their university\u2019s arm into divesting from companies like Boeing will pressure these companies to stop building weapons that may be used to kill Palestinian women and children. \n\nhttps://time.com/6974063/divestment-explained-campus-protest-israel/\n\nThere\u2019s a whole host of unanswered questions for me, like why protest colleges and not the US government directly?  But I suppose colleges are smaller fish to debate and colleges like Brown are negotiating divestment with students as a direct response to the protests. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/04/universities-allow-student-campus-protest-encampments\n\nEdit: this comment is a great write up about why it\u2019s so hard to pinpoint \u201cwho started it\u201d and why the most important thing may instead be \u201cwhat\u2019s are we going to do about it in the future\u201d, hopefully less killings on both sides. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/s/coDRWpbE0D",

She was very annoyed at the student protests and was confused why anyone would side against the Israelis after the Oct 7th attack. She genuinely did not know tens of thousands of Palestinian children had died and continue to die. \n\nBoth sides have committed war crimes. Specifically the children are the victims. One started it and brutally killed 36 children, but the other side continues to commit war crimes and has killed 13,800 children and counting. And the US is funding the ongoing violence. And they can\u2019t escape either. There is no excuse as to oopsie kill that many children. \n\nHamas is a terrorist organization and shouldn\u2019t be funded, but Netanyahu probs shouldn\u2019t be funded until there\u2019s some sort of ceasefire and the Egypt border open/ (or other option) for women and children to escape. It\u2019s complex but I can understand from an empathy perspective how that many dead children is something people want to end.",

It's not just about whether the response is proportional, but what the actual goals of the Israeli government is. If their goal is to get the hostages back, they could have taken the deal offered by Hamas yesterday. If their goal is actually \"[complete victory](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/defiant-netanyahu-declares-israels-goal-is-complete-victory-in-gaza-after-un-court-ruling)\" as Netanyahu has stated, presumably continuing the siege and famine on Rafah until Hamas surrenders, then as an American Jew I find that a completely unacceptable level of response and far beyond being \"similarly heinous\" to what Hamas did on October 7th.\n\nHamas, who's leadership resides in Qatar, cannot be defeated this way ([according to an EU diplomat](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-josep-borrell-israel-hamas-military-means-munich-security-conference/)). It would appear to me that Israel wants Gaza bulldozed, but even if they succeed in the genocidal act of doing so, the children who survive this conflict will likely turn into radical extremists, as we've seen happen so many times previously, so I question even the efficacy of their strategy, beyond it's immorality.\n\nIsrael is also risking dragging Iran into a war, which would be nightmarish scenario for Iran, Israel and the US.",

Can you give any examples of that happening in this conflict that doesn't come from the IDF? Particularly at a rate that explains the number of civilian casualties? That's not to say it doesn't happen - I'm just curious because I know it's happened in the past. \n\nIn terms of a 'proportional response', I'm not sure about other countries operating under this constraint, but that doesn't mean it's a bad standard. I think most people agree that the US used more force than necessary in invading the middle east. I suppose you could argue that protests against that war was people attempting to place that same constraint.\n\nI'd also push back on the identities of the victims of October 7th having to do with 'proportional responses', especially when civilian deaths are involved. What happened that day was clearly horrific and a tragedy, but when invoked in discussing the magnitude of response, I worry that it just paves the way for civilian death on the other side, which is also horrible. By that logic, what is to stop Palestinians from seeing massacres at hospitals and aid sites and deciding on their own response? Where would it end?",

Maybe that was the start.\n\nThe current conflict is happening in the Gaza strip, which didn't even exist as a separate entity during the Nakba, so maybe the Suez crisis, which precipitated the 1967 war that separated Gaza, can be blamed as the start.\n\nOr maybe it goes all the way back to the Muslim conquests of the 7th century or the Jewish-Roman wars of the 1st century that began a long period of violence, enslavement, expulsion, displacement, forced conversion, and forced migration against the local Jewish population.\n\nWe could pick dozens of points in history to be an originating event, which is why \"who started it\" gets us nowhere. \n\nBut if we accept the root causes as nationalism, sectarianism, tribalism, racism, and the general tendency for humans to band together to kill each other, then it doesn't really matter what start date you set. The cause of these conflicts isn't what we do or when we do it, it's who we are and who we want to be.",

I understand your position, and you think past violence justify current violence, which is fair. But, if we say violence is okay, we also have to accept the consequence of the violence, like the death of hundreds of thousands of innocent women and children.\n\nIt's like saying you want to choose \"trial by combat\", but then getting upset when your opponent hit you. Let's think about who chose this path. Only about [15% of Israelis are in favor of their current government led by Netanyahu](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/only-15-israelis-want-netanyahu-keep-job-after-gaza-war-poll-finds-2024-01-02/), but [around 70% of Palestinians support the Hamas leadership](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-palestinians-opinion-poll-wartime-views-a0baade915619cd070b5393844bc4514). If we think the leaders are the ones who lead to these conflicts, it looks like the Palestinian side has more responsibility for the current situation than the Israeli side.\n\nYou might say Israel's reaction is disproportionate and without due diligence, which I totally agree with. But, Israel's reaction was also something we could have predicted. It's like if you poke a bear and then it attacks you, did the bear go too far? Maybe. But was poking the bear a good idea in the first place? If you think poking the bear was necessary, then it wouldn't make sense to be upset about the bear's reaction.",

A [local NBC](https://mynbc15.com/news/nation-world/iranian-college-to-offer-scholarships-to-expelled-us-student-protesters-report-says-iran-shiraz-university-mohammad-moazzeni-anti-israel-pro-palestine-middle-east-conflict-columbia-ucla) has covered it. \n\n> Mohammad Moazzeni, the head of Shiraz University, reportedly argued this week such protesters are being treated too harshly by police. This approach by American officials, he reportedly claimed, indicates a global collapse.\n> \n>> \"They exert a lot of violence in order to contain this raging movement and have even threatened to expel the students from universities and hinder their employment in the future, and such autocratic methods show the decline of global arrogance,\u201d Moazzeni said, according to PressTV.\n> \n> Shiraz University will also accept expelled professors, Moazzeni reportedly added.\n\nI'm not sure if this indicates that Iran is behind the student protests, or just taking advantage of the situation to disparage the US. There are a number of entities, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthi rebels, with [alleged ties to Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism#List_of_entities_with_alleged_ties_to_Iran). I'm curious if they are also working behind the scenes to connect with, encourage, or support the pro-Palestinian protests.",

There's also the fact that [half of those arrested at a couple of the campus protests were non-students.](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/04/1249188864/nyc-columbia-city-college-gaza-protests-palestinian-campus)\n\nThe Reuters article I linked in the submission says the [Students for Justice in Palestine](https://nationalsjp.org/) is one of the organizers of the protests and they have a map on their site of \"Gaza Solidarity Encampments\" at various universities. The group was [founded in 2001](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/education/edlife/middle-east-conflict-on-campus-anti-semitism.html) at the University of California, Berkeley, and has been promoting divestment policies since then. It didn't suddenly spring up in response to the current war. \n\nSJP certainly could have used the opportunity to further their cause, but there is [ample evidence](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/how-a-generation-is-being-politicized-on-palestine) they're organizing the protests, including by circulating a tool kit in the immediate aftermath of October 7th calling the Hamas attacks \u201ca historic win for the Palestinian resistance.\u201d\n\nThat same article includes unsubstantiated accusations that Hamas funds SJP. Attempts by at least [one other news organization to follow the money](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/s-palestinian-protests-us-rcna143666) have been relatively fruitless as well, so we really don't know how they're funded.",

                            "body": "Between my initial comment and the subsequent replies, I think that the rationale for why one might suspect Iran could be interested in cultivating unrest in the USA has been established fairly well. This includes but is not limited to Iran trying to interfere or sow unrest in the USA previously. And also note that I made no claim of certainty that Iran \\*created\\* the protests. I explicitly and intentionally identified two potential avenues, one of which was Iran simply being reactive to take advantage of the situation and try to highlight the protests.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's proven for this case (nobody has claimed such), nor that anyone must agree with the thought, but I think it's sufficiently established as reasonable. As another example, a recent [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/business/media/campus-protests-russia-china-iran-us.html) discusses precisely this concept:\n\n>As protests over the war in Gaza have spread across the United States, Russia, China and Iran have seized on them to score geopolitical points abroad and stoke tensions within the United States, according to researchers who have identified both overt and covert efforts by the countries to amplify the protests since they began.\n\nAnd regarding possibilities of success, in the past the [FBI commented on ISIL/ISIS radicalizing westerners via online channels](https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/isil-online-countering-terrorist-radicalization-and-recruitment-on-the-internet-and-social-media-). And a [report by START at University of Maryland](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_PIRUS_UseOfSocialMediaByUSExtremists_ResearchBrief_July2018.pdf) (START is a research center concerning terrorism headquartered at UMD) discussed the use of social media for recruiting/radicalizing people. It has risen dramatically over the years. For example, figures 1 and 2 highlight that from 2003 - 2010, social media accounted for roughly 26 percent of radicalization, with 73% having no social media radicalization. From 2011-2016 that basically flipped, and only 27% had no social media radicalization, while for about 73% social media played a primary or secondary role.\n\nSo I don't think it's unreasonable to consider that Iran might be able to run online campaigns to encourage unrest or protests. Again, not proven, but proof-of-concept is there, rationale is there, and past history is there. I don't think this is really a stretch.",
