Meanwhile by limiting the market price will cause long term issues in the market; limited profitability will cause manufactures to limit production/exit the market/etc leading to potential shortages.\n\nIn the case of extreme price caps (eg https://ifreetrade.org/?/article/how_price_controls_devastated_venezuelas_economy) a whole black market was established as cheap goods were exported from the country via the black market.",

It doesn't super matter anyway since all that affects equilibria pricing is local behavior (that is how the curves behave near the equilibrium).\n\nAnd considering the counterfactual where in the vicinity of equilibrium more units produced means the marginal cost of increased production goes down - if you observe that you're in that situation then either the item in question is about to get super cheap since increasing demand will lower prices so you don't need price caps anyway, or there's some monopolistic funny business going on and the FTC owes someone an antitrust suit.\n\nETA: all this math only applies where competition between firms is possible. If there's collusion between producers it all falls apart and you need external measures to reintroduce competition and price controls based on rigorous economic study of the true equilibrium price may work as a stopgap. Generally speaking if the government had perfect knowledge of the true equilibrium price it would be just as good as the market equilibrium, the issue is that in a functioning competitive market if you introduce price caps lower than the true equilibrium you introduce a deadweight loss ie a reduction in total value generated.\n\nETA2: this is why relatively progressive economists will advocate for taxing the rich and giving poor people money and for breaking up monopolies and other forms of relevant regulation rather than price controls - the whole point of using markets is that under certain conditions if you appropriately tax externalities and prevent monopolies and such they'll maximize generated economic value, and running a command economy that actually works - which is on a technical level the same as correctly setting price controls for everything, is brutally difficult on a technical level to the point that I don't think anyone who understands the technical difficulty of the problem thinks it can be done.",

Maybe they'll change their minds later, but at the moment they choose to make the purchase they'd rather have the product than have X dollars.\n\nConsider a multiversal experiment where we took the same person at the same moment and using the same context and messaging and everything offered them the same product with the only difference being the price, and they could choose yes to buy or no not to buy. At some price there'd be a breakpoint at which they're indifferent between having the money and having the item, below which they'd pay and above which they'd say fuckit I'll keep my money. Again ignore any psychological manipulation or other dishonest crap (which personally I think is a big fucking problem with how the economy works irl and needs greater academic scrutiny as a source of market failure but then again I'm not a real economist I'm just an interdisciplinary scientist who's coauthored with a couple of them so what so I know). Consider that every person would have that one price below which they'd buy and above which they wouldn't buy. It's therefore inferred that that indifference price is the subjective value the person places on the product. If Jim McRandomperson is indifferent between having 10 dollars and having the product, then that product is worth exactly 10 dollars subjectively to Jim.\n\nThe demand function for a price p tells you the number of people for whom that subjective indifference price is greater than p.... Or it could be the other way around, economists have the most insane naming conventions since they didn't start doing real math until the last century and have weird naming habits from dead people people doing the bullshit you implicitly accused me of in your first reply. But either way it's the same monotonic relationship between price p and quantity of purchases q.\n\nThen the consumer surplus - the economic value created for the consumers - is the sum over all people of the difference between their subjective valuation of the product and the price .

The areas to take problem with an argument like that are:  \n- Do the premises actually hold in reality, which is one possible objection to various applications of economic thought  \n- Are the inference steps correct. How vague are they? Theology arguments usually utilize higher level concepts than the mathematical arguments which underly certain economics concepts like price ceilings    \n- Are there other implications from those same premises which are important?\n\nThe person you're replying to has some good explanations of the specifics.",

Google \u201c1970 gas shortage\u201d.\n\nEssentially producers choose what quantity to produce based off the price, and if they can only get a lower price, they will produce less. This leads to widespread shortages, and is true regardless of the product in question. \n\nIn 1970 when a gas price cap was implemented, people waited days trying to fill up their cars, and while it saved the consumer money, it was traded in for time waiting for gas. \n\nNow, if the government could create production minimums alongside this, that may alleviate some of the effects temporarily, but if they/the market doesn\u2019t get to choose the price, they may choose to exit the business altogether. With suppliers dropping out of unprofitable markets, you\u2019d be right back to a shortage. \n\nThe market has to choose the price, which is based on supply and demand, especially for homogeneous products like oil and gas. \n\n\nhttps://reason.com/2022/03/04/pump-prices-are-going-up-but-thats-a-helluva-lot-better-than-1970s-gas-rationing/\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/may/15/20060515-122820-6110r/\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/05/13/gas-shortages-1970s/",
