Here's the [source document](https://policymemos.hks.harvard.edu/files/policymemos/files/2-23-22_ukraine-the_budapest_memo.pdf?m=1645824948) in case anyone wants to review but I copied and pasted the key points and marked who violated them.  \n  \nTLDR:  US and UK didn't violate the Budapest Memorandum at all.  Russia violated multiple provisions of the Budapest Memorandum.\n  \n1. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland, reaffirm their commitment to\nUkraine, in accordance with the principles of the CSCE\n[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe]\nFinal Act, to respect the Independence and Sovereignty\nand the existing borders of Ukraine.  \n * Signatory countries will respected Ukraine's borders.  \n * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Fail.  \n2. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland, reaffirm their obligation to refrain\nfrom the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that\nnone of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine\nexcept in self-defense or otherwise in accordance with\nthe Charter of the United Nations.  \n * Don't threaten to use force on Ukraine or use force.  \n * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Fail.  \n3. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland, reaffirm their commitment to\nUkraine, in accordance with the principles of the CSCE \nFinal Act, to refrain from economic coercion designed\nto subordinate to their own interest the exercise by\nUkraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and\nthus to secure advantages of any kind.  \n * Don't use economic cooercion on Ukraine to get what you want.  \n * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Fail.  \n4. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland, reaffirm their commitment to seek\nimmediate United Nations Security Council action to\nprovide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon\nState Party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim\nof an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.  \n * If Ukraine is attacked with nukes or threatened with nukes, the US, UK, and Russian Federation promise to take the matter to the UNSC.  \n * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Fail.  \n5. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland, reaffirm, in the case of the Ukraine,\ntheir commitment not to use nuclear weapons against\nany non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, except in\nthe case of an attack on themselves, their territories or\ndependent territories, their armed forces, or their allies,\nby such a state in association or alliance with a nuclear\nweapon state.  \n * Don't attack Ukraine with nukes unless Ukraine attacks you first when allied with nuclear power.  \n * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Fail.  \n6. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland will consult in the event a situation\narises which raises a question concerning these commitments.  \n * If something concerning happens, all parties will talk about it.  \n * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Pass (technically they have also talked... along with attacking).",
