The US wants to retaliate, so they authorize Ukraine to make a certain number of strikes against Russian targets in some western oblasts, let's just say 20. They have to authorize each strike though. Then, Russia attacks a Ukrainian city with a nonlethal chemical weapon. To retaliate, the US allows more strikes into Russia that they still have to approve, but this time there are significantly more, say 50. The purpose of this is to convince Russia to stop doing things the US dislikes as the US doesn't really have much to leverage in terms of pressuring Russia to not do something again.!<\n\nSo, giving the Ukrainians an artificial limit allows that limit to be lifted if they ever want to retaliate for something. There's a concept called \"[The Escalation Ladder](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2022/9/1/reconstructing-the-ladder-towards-a-more-considered-model-of-escalation)\" that shows how countries tend to escalate conflict. The link provided shows a modern take on it. What the US is doing is effectively adding new rungs to the escalation ladder that can be used later.",

                            "body": "Okay, this could just be me being dumb, but how does this feed into an image of NATO being predatory?\n\nIn my mind, this shows that the US and NATO want to limit possible escalation but also have more ways to retaliate against Russia for doing bad things. It's putative rather than purely defensive, but putative measures are usually taken from a defensive stance, not an offensive one. In any scenario of escalation, it is Russia doing something wrong or bad to which NATO responds\n You need some way of escalating without boots on the ground or nuclear war, as more types of weapons are sent, the number of ways to retaliate to Russian misdeeds shrinks. And, inevitably, if there are no more ways for NATO to escalate without boots on the ground, Russia will exploit this by doing whatever they want. Allowing and approving limited strikes allows for a perpetual way of punishing Russia without causing out-of-control escalation. \n\nNow, I don't have access to NATO war planners, but usage of the escalation ladder is commonplace in NATO discussions. The inherent concern with any escelation ladder is \"What do we do when we reach the top? How do we prevent out of control escalation?\" Well, this provides a solution\n\nAlso, to be totally clear, this isn't the only reason for NATO to do this, as with most ideas on complex topics, there are many reasons the idea or decision occurred. The two major ones here are probably the base \"To prevent escalation\" at, say, 50% of the reasoning, then \"To allow perpetual retaliation\" at 40%, and a bunch of more minor reasons in the last 10%.",

This, as the thread began, was about the US restriction on weapons to not be used in Russia, and what those concerns were. Your comment raises a theoretical premise whose shadow very much resembles the one cast by the bogeyman Putin\u2019s uses to portray NATO to his people, and beyond. Anyway, that is why I am skeptical: there may be some in the wargaming crowd who have this idea in their heads. But sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. We\u2019re giving them the arms they need to defend themselves, we don\u2019t want them to use them beyond their own borders, full stop.",

I think we can reasonably add that there is a concern that it would be seen as unacceptable by the world community, a change from self-defense to attack would reduce the likelihood of future support.  That one's my own personal thought, though, not one that is substantiated elsewhere.  Of course, that mostly applies to *actual armies*.  Saboteurs and Partisans seem to be fair game.",
