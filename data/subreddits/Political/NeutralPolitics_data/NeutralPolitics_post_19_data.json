            "body": "Just so people are informed, it's a good idea to understand how marginal progressive tax rates work. This [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYeZko1WKHQ) (transcript in the description) explains it pretty well. The upshot is, the top marginal rate is not the rate paid on every dollar earned, and most people don't make enough that any of their income will even reach that rate.\n\nCapital gains are currently taxed at a preferential (lower for most taxpayers) rate. The administration's proposal is to tax long term capital gains as ordinary income for those earning more than $1 million per year in adjusted gross income. From OP's source about the revenue proposals:\n\n> Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends of taxpayers with taxable income of more than $1 million would be taxed at ordinary rates   \n> [...]   \n>  For example, a taxpayer with $1,100,000 in taxable income of which $200,000 is preferential capital income would have $100,000 of capital income taxed at the preferential rate and $100,000 taxed at ordinary rates.\n\nBecause the proposed change targets high earners in this way, it [would affect fewer than 0.3 percent of taxpayers,](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/biden-proposals-would-reduce-large-tax-advantages-for-those-at-the-top-address) and only in the years when they sell long-term capital assets for a gain.\n\nA few years back, [we discussed the idea of taxing capital gains as ordinary income](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/bjujtn/what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_taxing_capital/) for *all* taxpayers. The top comment there is very informative and strongly in favor of the idea. The current Biden proposal doesn't go so far, as it only applies to the top 0.3% of earners. So, on the surface, this proposal seems well targeted and relatively tame.\n\nAs to whether it's worth it, probably not. It's a safe bet that many high earners will either shift their investments away from such assets or find ways to shelter their gains from the tax, so I'd be surprised if the government ever sees close to the projected revenue increase from this move. And even if it did, $289 billion over 10 years is just 0.3% of the [total projected budgets over the same period.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/budget_fy2025.pdf) This seems like a pretty significant shift to the tax code that's easily circumvented, may have some deleterious effects, and doesn't raise a lot of money. There are more effective and efficient ways to increase revenue in the same proposal and my belief is that it'd be better to concentrate on those.",
