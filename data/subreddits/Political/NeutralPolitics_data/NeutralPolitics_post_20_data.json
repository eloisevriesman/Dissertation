I am not proposing to decide why the people of Haiti need their money, they should be able to spend it how they wish, however even if we go forward with the presumption that repayement is objectively the right,  then repaying them now, would only benefit a couple people in their government who would likely embezzle much of the funds, or the gangs who currently control their capital, and would also not solve the issue, as activists would very likely continue to demand repayement on the basis that the funds were embezzled. \n\nLastly, while I am not French, and in the end the decision rests with the French people and their government, the repayement of decades or centuries old reperations is difficult to justify. Especially for a country such as France, in which [only 86%](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/3633212#tableau-infographie) of their population is born with citizenship, meaning that at least 14% is born to two immigrants (There are far more second or third generation immigrants), meaning that those 14% would be paying for reperations they, nor their ancestors had anything to do with, that is if we assume that guilt and responsibilty passes on to children of perpetrators, which I would also opposes, however that is a purely subjective statement.",

Haitian reparations money built the Eiffel tower and specific wealthy families have who benefited into the 20th century have been identified. If it sends France into chaos to repay Haiti back their money, well, that would be poetic.\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/world/americas/haiti-history-colonized-france.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\nFrom the article above and there is plenty more if you read on.  \n\n\u201cBut for generations after independence, Haitians were forced to pay the descendants of their former slave masters, including the Empress of Brazil; the son-in-law of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I; Germany\u2019s last imperial chancellor; and Gaston de Galliffet, the French general known as the \u201cbutcher of the Commune\u201d for crushing an insurrection in Paris in 1871.\n\nThe burdens continued well into the 20th century. The wealth [Haitian] ancestors coaxed from the ground (coffee and sugar) brought wild profits for a French bank that helped finance the Eiffel Tower, Cr\u00e9dit Industriel et Commercial, and its investors. They controlled Haiti\u2019s treasury from Paris for decades, and the bank eventually became part of one of Europe\u2019s largest financial conglomerates.\u201d",

These payments continued until 1947 and represent a real part of the chronic economic dysfunction of Haiti, and while they total only 21 billion by one estimate, the interest and opportunity cost is likely a great deal higher, with the latter being difficult to calculate numerically.\n\nThe issue about corruption is absolutely warranted: 200 billion dollars getting dumped on Haiti is probably not going to be well used, but the chicken and egg issue is that without funding there will never be a stable government if it isn't funded, but the lack of stability is one of the reasons used to defer funding.",

This sum was at some point cut in half ~13 years later, and finally Haiti only paid 113m francs total ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti_Independence_Debt)).\n\nWhile the $21b figure cited by Wikipedia and elsewhere is cited as fact, I've never seen a scholarly, accepted source ([one source they reference](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/world/americas/haiti-aristide-reparations-france.html)), and sounds like simple wishful thinking, without seeing some data to back this up (of course, inflation calculators already have the 'expected return of having money' baked into them, as they compare [buying power](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/purchasingpower.asp) of the currency to get an accurate measure).\n\nYou're also no doubt assuming there is no justification for the indemnity to begin with, and like many on this platform probably assume it has something to do with the cost of the slaves. From what I've read, this isn't the case.\n\nFirst the calculation - [source documents](https://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_1631-0438_2003_num_90_340_4058) show it to be a calculation based on the amount of money earned from Haitian plantations over the years preceding the slave revolution. Nothing to do with the value of slaves or other property, but an expected return from farming the region optimally. And this is not unfounded; the land was owned by the French, though it could be said they took it from the [Taino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno) (which if you accept would imply neither the former slaves nor the French should control it). Ignoring that, there was a claim by the owners that their land was taken from them and they wanted restitution. Naturally in modern times, we would say the land was suitable forfeit for the atrocities inflicted upon the Africans brought to Haiti, and - like with the US revolution - would say those living there deserve the spoilers of their justly waged war.\n\nBut unfortunately, it didn't end there. The [revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution#1791_slave_rebellion) itself had many phases lasting from 1791-1804, after the conclusion of which it was decided by the Haitian powers that all whites in Haiti should be killed, with women and children not being spared (a few Poles and Germans were, though). I've read that \"Caribbean genocide: racial war in Haiti\" by Girard is a good summary that describes both said murders and rampant raping of said victims before their eventual slaying, but I can't find a non pay-gated version; there is a fanstatic [summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ktt0j/would_the_1804_haiti_massacre_of_the_white_french/) from a question in AskHistories some years back. Basically, the French has really good reason to dislike the Haitians, as what might have been forgiven as the inevitable loss of land instead escalated into one of the most complete race focused genocides of a people that I am aware of.\n\nFrom that, the French being less forgiving of perceived economic losses feels a bit less absurd, in context. \n\nAlso it's worth mentioning that Haiti has received a [colossal amount of aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_aid_to_Haiti#:~:text=Between%20the%20fiscal%20years%20of,this%2C%20living%20conditions%20remain%20poor.) in the last century, which eclipses payments made on the debt, which itself ended in 1947.",

Nothing to do with the value of slaves or other property, but an expected return from farming the region optimally.\n\nYou can't really separate the \"expected return from farming the region\" from the fact that the laborers that were farming the region were enslaved. I get what you're saying about the Independence debt being based on the loss of land, but saying \"nothing to do with the value of slaves\" is kinda disingenuous. All of these things were inextricably linked in the early modern colonial economy of the Caribbean. These societies have been called \"slave societies\" rather than  \"societies with slaves,\" because the early modern plantation complex of the Caribbean was fundamentally structured around enslaved labor ([source](https://www.uwipress.com/9789766405854/the-first-black-slave-society/)). So, while I do agree that it is not exactly accurate to say that the self-liberated Haitians had to \"pay for their own freedom,\" their enslavement was a requisite for the economy to function. Even if the calculations were based on a model of production where laborers were actually paid a wage ( can't tell from the docs you shared cuz I dont know French ha), the argument you mention about the Am Rev and the 'spoils of war' I think is relevant, like you said. No empire has ever paid for territory they conquer, I don't think, and to my knowledge it certainly never happened in the Caribbean / the Americas during the conquest or the wars for Latin Am wars of Independence.\n\nBut regarding the terrifying racial violence that took place on the island post-Independence, this was an entirely reactionary response to what was the equally horrendous violence of plantation slavery in the Caribbean. Laurent Dubois has talked about this (there's an article version somewhere out there but probably also behind a paywall, reference is [here](https://thelouvertureproject.org/index.php?title=Avenging_America:_The_Politics_of_Violence_in_the_Haitian_Revolution), but both of his books [Avengers of the New World](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674018266) and [Haiti: The Aftershocks of History](https://history.duke.edu/books/haiti-aftershocks-history) provide a lot of necessary context for the discussion of the history of violence and the Haitian Revolution). The colonial society of French Saint-Domingue was one built around racial terror and violence (this is Beckles \"Slave society\" model). African slaves were often worked to death, as a matter of practice, and sexual violence against enslaved women was the norm. I agree with you that the violence that succeeded the Haitian Revolution against the remaining white population was horrifying, racially motivated, and institutionalized, but it was also very obviously reactionary to the equally horrifying, racially motivated, and institutionalized violence of colonial French society in Saint-Domingue. So I think in any discussion of reparations, the French having \"really good reason to dislike the Haitians\" is kind of a non-starter; its the exact same \"really good reason\" that the Haitians had to dislike the French. So if neither side can claim the moral high ground because of violence committed, then I think it stands to reason that Haiti never should have had to pay any indemnity in the first place.",

Even though I disagree with your use of the word genocide, I understand why you're using it (the violence was racialized, it was institutionally sanctioned, it had an exterminatory goal, etc). I think this perspective really only holds up when you remove the post-Revolution reactionary violence from the wider historical context of socially sanctioned violence on the island.\n\nLike, would you call the Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula a genocide? The Christian Kingdoms, particularly Castile, slaughtered and pillaged the Muslim taifas, they carried out numerous pograms against Spanish Jews, they banished Muslims and Jews from the Christian Kingdoms, and they created institutions and cultural norms specifically to identify and murder any that remained in secret. Does this qualify as a genocide, even though the peninsula was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate centuries earlier?\n\nBut lets call it a genocide for the sake of your argument:\n\n>the seizure of all land and property in Haiti, coupled with the subsequent genocide, provides at least defensible justification to demand recompense\n\nWould you apply this same logic to indigenous peoples and their relationship to the United States? For sure its a completely different context with different circumstances and historical processes at play, but the use of the word genocide to describe American expansion in the 19th century is quite common, even though some people disagree.\n\nI'm not trying to deflect and change the subject, I think this debate is a really important one-- like which historical injustices warrant recompense, and which do not, if we can come to some consensus around this we stand a chance of really solving a lot of problems. So like I think if we are going to use the word genocide, and if genocidal processes = deserving of recompense, then how do we apply that logic consistently? I guess what I mean is I think there is a contradiction in your argument because on the one hand, the French deserved reparations for the Haitian Revolution, and on the other Haiti deserves none, not just because of the genocide against white French subjects, but because it happened long ago. \n\nI don't want you to take this as like an attempted gotcha or something, or as a like a morally charged non-sequitur. I think broadening the discussion is useful in this instance. I'm genuinely curious what your take is. I think its clear you put a lot of thought into this topic.",

The other being \"these people (Muslims) have and will continue to rule over our land as tyrants if we allow them to stay, so they must all be disposed of\", which is something of a \"we'll do this objectively bad thing because if we don't we'll die\" situation, from their viewpoint. I think there is a big difference between \"people that are X are not welcome here - you must leave or we will kill you\" and \"people that are X are not welcome here, but you *can't* leave, so we can be sure to slaughter you all\", which combined with the desire for self preservation and autonomy of a conquered people makes it a meaningfully different situation than Haiti. Certainly, those participating were no doubt often guilty of unjustified wholesale murder and rape, and if the Moors has the ability, they would have been justified in demanding similar reparations *at the time*, but I don't know of a large systemic campaign to specifically *kill* all Muslims in the region (such a program would of course add further justification for reparations to be paid).\n\nI think for the US, there were a lot of dishonest dealings on the part of the budding nation, but generally were responding to a series of back-and-forth escalations in which both sides could be ascribed some blame. It wasn't fair, and it was deemed reasonable to provide such peoples recompense, in the form of (eventually) the reservation system. A random google search suggests an acre of US land is ~$16k, and 56 million such a acres are reserved for American Indians, which could be viewed as nearly $1 trillion in restitution paid. By 1800 [only 600k](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjdt_665385/2649_665393/202203/t20220302_10647120.html#:~:text=Before%20the%20arrival%20of%20white,237%2C000%2C%20the%20lowest%20in%20history.) such peoples remained in the US, which could be worked out to say we gave each $2m (obviously this ignores those killed or displaced in the pre-revolution era). It was reasonable to provide restitution, and the US did so, all without the willful genocide of the race from the nation.\n\nTo sum up my own moral compass for this, as I understand it currently - no son is responsible for the crimes of this father; on death, a person's possessions would first go to making whole those he wronged before being passed to a child, but the responsibility ends there - unpaid recompense doesn't span generational boundaries. If your grandfather murdered mine, it is not on you and all your descendants to eternally be indebted to mine. But institutions aren't people, and governments don't \"die\". When Nazi Germany was defeated, they took on debts that they agreed to repay for the country's misdeeds, even after all the perpetrators has passed away. But the persistence of such obligation only occurs as a results of a promise from the institution, as there isn't an agreed upon higher authority to enforce such responsibilities. They continue to pay because they said they would, but could at any time stop doing so, with potentially serious consequences But that's true of any country, not just Haiti (e.g., if the US decided to set its debt to $0, nobody will send gunboats, but it would possibly lead to the end of the nation due to economic ramifications). And of course every nation everywhere is responsible for deeds that are considered evil through a modern lens. Should not the African nations provide the *most* reparations for slavery, as it was they who actually *enslaved* people in the first place? But nobody is marching through the streets in Angola or Nigeria demanding money be paid to Haitians.\n\nThere's also a really grey area of who owes what to whom. Do people who leave a nation retain the responsibilities their nation incurred? Do those immigrating to a nation inherit these responsibilities, despite not having gained any benefit?  It becomes impossible to reasonably divvy up responsibility, or who 'deserves' what.  I think beyond the dubious moral standpoint, there are a lot of practical reasons such payouts could/should not be done.\n\nSo the reason Haiti owed what was demanded in the 1820's was because it slaughtered every member of a race/nationality of people on their island in 1804; they were strong-armed to agree to pay it, but there was plentiful moral justification in the French demand. Haiti continued to be obligated to pay it more because they agreed to pay it - and the ramifications for refusing - than because they 'should do the right thing'.",

Like in the Native American example, the land/value calculus is compelling, until you get into the knitty gritty of what land they were given, and what kinds of resources that land/environment allowed (there's a reason why the Trail of Tears led from the fertile southeast to the badlands of Oklahoma area.) But moreover, how do you quantify the damage done to a people, collective and individual, by something like compulsory boarding schools? These institutions were crucial to the destruction of native community and culture, and are [considered ](https://worldwithoutgenocide.org/genocides-and-conflicts/american-indian/indian-boarding-schools#:~:text=In%201969%2C%20a%20Senate%20report,that%20boarding%20schools%20took%20children)a key aspect of why we use the word genocide to describe US expansionism. \n\nAnyway one thing I think you might find interesting is a [law that was passed in Spain](https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/losangeles/es/Comunicacion/Noticias/Documents/BillGrantingSpanishCitizenship%20(2).pdf) in 2105 that offers citizenship to any descendent of Sephardic Jews who was expelled in the 1500s-- its interesting they do not do the same for Muslims, but then again the pograms against the jews were definitely more akin to genocide than just expulsion. Its an interesting example of citizenship-as-solution to longstanding historically contingent social/political/economic problems.",

I do agree my back-of-the-napkin numbers are less than scientific, and there are a lot of variables that could adjust them one way or another, but trying to arrive at some sort of number allows us to analytically compare situations, which takes a bit of the emotional response out of any judgements. That said, people aren't good at spotting bad stats arguments, so it's too easy to get data supporting a conclusion accepted by people eager demonstrate that conclusion (certainly numerous examples of this in modern times...).\n\nGoing back to a brief response, one point is that if your grandfather had an additional $10k, how much would you realistically have today? You could perhaps be up $10k in your bank account today, ignoring siblings' portions and such. It could be that he would have invested it wisely, and you'd be up $50k. But probably, he gets the high shelf whisky for a few months, gets maybe the leather seats on that new car, etc, and the net doesn't affect you at all.\n\nAlso if you really look at things too holistically, it muddies the waters further. If American Indians are owed in modern times for wrongs dealt to them in history, do they not owe (or at least have that debt offset) for benefits they gain? If Europeans somehow never found or came to the Americas, presumably the daily life for inhabitants would be today what it was 1000 years ago, as they had already lived on the continent 30k+ years prior.  Would you rather be a native of the region, untouched by foreigners and left to nature, as it was thousands of years ago, or a modern American Indian today, with the various problems and privileges that come with it?  It's easy to watch a documentary and yearn for simpler times, but realistically - life has gotten *really* good for even middle-low income humans in the first world.  \n\nObviously this sort of logic doesn't work for individual cases of mistreatment, where the victim and perpetrator are still living parties in some dispute, but if we *must* examine 'what was the effect of this group of people, with whom I share some ethnic ancestry, on that group of people, with whom you share some ethnic ancestry' with the goal of deciding 'who owes who what', you would have to look at both sides of the scale. Though even talking about it, I continue to find this ethnic responsibility because of the actions of some ancestors distasteful, and tend to look at people as individuals in pretty much all cases.\n\nOne point I think you'll agree with is that well intentioned people - both educated and not - can honestly reach different conclusions. And just because you agree with some premise, it's perfectly okay - and healthy - to argue against bad justifications for that premise. I have in the past been more critical of those arguing for AA in the US, for reasons not unrelated to our above conversation, and thought poorly of everyone that disagreed with me. As I've been exposed to more ideas and justifications, I have come to honestly believe that those that disagree with me are wrong, often illogical, but still with their hearts in the right place, responding to situations that really are very complicated and difficult to understand. I wish more people were willing to accept that others can have contrary opinions, and still be good people. I have good friends on the left that talk as if every conservative is a mini anti-Christ, but I grew up in swing states, so I know a lot of good (if flawed) people that are ardent Trump supporters to this day. I suspect this disconnect, and unwillingness to engage honestly is what pushes people further toward their respective sides, and away from sanity.  In net, thanks for talking with me :)",

The Ottoman Empire was the successor state of the various Arab States involved in the Arab slave trade, which Balkanized into various successor states. \n\nFrance has undergone significant cultural and population shifts in the intervening years, and the main beneficiaries of Haitian debt were in the aristocratic class which was a vanishingly small proportion of the French population at the time. \n\nThe Reparations for the Haitian Indemnity are not 1:1 with Reparations with the Arab slave trade, but it is in the same ballpark.\n\nFurther, the people today that have directly benefited are a lot messier than you think, original payment was made over a period of 5 years and ended in the 1830s. The payments that ended in 1947 were for loans Haiti took out to pay the original indemnity. Many of these loans were from 3rd parties (mostly Americans) that had nothing to do with the original deal. If my mechanic overcharges me on my repair, and I pay it by mortgaging my house, it isn't the bank's fault my mechanic screwed me.\n\nAnother thing, the Haitian Indemnity was first proposed by the Haitian President to try to get France to open up diplomatic relations. Countries are not owed recognition or trading rights with another country and the deal that was originally stuck was for the massive indemnity. It was certainly unreasonable of France to demand such a sum, but Haiti didn't have to take that deal. (I'm being a bit reductive here but it's a reddit comment, sue me)\n\nFinally, clearly Haiti needs help right now since they aren't doing so hot. And France should probably greatly contribute considering Haiti is a Francophone nation and having another strong and stable Francophone nation will benefit France. The US should also greatly contribute considering Haiti is not too far off its coast, and having a failed state so close by is a security concern.",

Again, I do not think this is a compelling or insightful comparison given that Haiti exists as an entity over the entire time in question while neither party in the historic Arabian slavery exists as an entity. \n\n>France has undergone significant cultural and population shifts in the intervening years, and the main beneficiaries of Haitian debt were in the aristocratic class which was a vanishingly small proportion of the French population at the time.\n\nTrue, but again significantly less so than equivalent comparisons with Arabic nations, and there has been continuity of rule (for the most part) in France for most of Haiti's existence. Shifts in Republic are significant (and I'd agree that Napoleon's government represents a legitimate break in continuity from a moral point of view) but I do not think mitigate the moral responsibility of modern day France (one France shares with a lot of former colonial nations).\n\n>It was certainly unreasonable of France to demand such a sum, but Haiti didn't have to take that deal. (I'm being a bit reductive here but it's a reddit comment, sue me)\n\nI think that one should not absolve a more powerful party of taking advantage of the weaker one on grounds like this. Not taking the deal was a measurable harm to Haiti, and being pressured into a bad deal by a more influential power is morally incorrect regardless. Doubly so given the harm to Haiti and the benefit that France enjoyed, in some cases within a human lifespan. \n\n>If my mechanic overcharges me on my repair, and I pay it by mortgaging my house, it isn't the bank's fault my mechanic screwed me.\n\nIf the funds necessary for the repayment must be sourced from several nations, that simply means the complexity is logistical, not moral. Honestly, the topic of how the US makes amends for centuries of South American policy is one that could fill several volumes, and should be considered separately for simplicity's sake. Fact of the matter is that there is little argument about the moral justice in reparations, only in accountability for who owes them, which indicates the discussion is largely on best how to make amends instead of should amends be made.\n\n>Finally, clearly Haiti needs help right now since they aren't doing so hot...**snip things I agree with**...Haiti is not too far off its coast, and having a failed state so close by is a security concern.\n\nAgreed, it is in both France and the US's interests to have a stable and successful Haiti, as well as (imo) a legitimate moral debt owed by both nations. Unfortunately, neither are great partners in the process, as they tend not to include Haitians in aid efforts, and there is a lot of bad will to overcome. One thing long term rebuilding programs require is...well long term commitment and a willingness to develop internal partners by demonstrating good faith. Haiti is a tough nut to crack because there's understandable skepticism on the local's part.",

My initial point was that modern France and Napoleonic France were two completely different states. One of their only commonalities are the peoples and cultures that live within that state. The people and cultures of the various Arabic states also share peoples and cultures with the historic Caliphates that conducted the slave trade. \n\nThe only similarity historic France shares with modern France are its people and culture, which the same comparison can be made for Arab States. \n\n>Not taking the deal was a measurable harm to Haiti\n\nWell not exactly. If you want to buy food from me, and I demand an outrageous price, you are not harmed by taking or not taking the deal, even if I'm being an ass by demanding an outrageous price. It's still giving you more options than you had before. \n\n>indicates the discussion is largely on best how to make amends instead of should amends be made\n\nThis is an interesting point, but I'd argue that the logistical challenge of correctly assigning blame for historical events that occurred 200 years ago is folly. Especially for something as complex as involving two entire nations of people. Should the Spanish pay Reparations to Latin America, despite the fact that the current residents of Latin America are almost all descendents of the factions of Spain that directly benefited from its pillage? The descendants of the perpetrators and the victims are the same people. \n\nWhile that isn't as much the case for Haiti, a similar complexity does still apply. It's important to note that 800 years ago is the most recent comment ancestor for virtually all humans (other than uncontacted tribes, or other similarly isolationist communities). Just about everyone has had ancestors that were both slaves and slavers. Everyone is descended from victims and perpetrators. \n\nCertainly some people have had more ancestors that were perpetrators or victims, but my point is that it gets really messy really fast. \n\n>being pressured into a bad deal by a more influential power is morally incorrect regardless\n\nI don't think moral frameworks are very useful to examine nations through. Nations are not moral actors. Their choices and sense of morality changes with each administration. Especially when they're as murky as reparations for centuries old problems. Instead, I think focusing on helping people and nations that are struggling now is a better use of mental effort and philosophizing. \n\nHaiti deserves help not because they were victimized 200 years ago, but because they are struggling right now. \n\n>One thing long term rebuilding programs require is...well long term commitment and a willingness to develop internal partners by demonstrating good faith. Haiti is a tough nut to crack because there's understandable skepticism on the local's part.\n\nYour entire last paragraph is quite right, Western countries and America in particular are quite good at immediate short term compassion, but aren't terribly great about making those long term commitments that are actually necessary to undo long term harm.",

I happen to think that large scale, voluntary wealth redistribution is in the interests of the developed world for a variety of reasons, from ethical to ecological, and that includes, at the very least, adapting the global economy to serve the needs of the Global South and developing world. If that takes the form of reparations to Haiti (in part) that is fine.\n\nI'm aware that this is a minority position and an unlikely turn of events, so I'll limit myself to the humanitarian and moral arguments here, where I think we sort of agree in principle and disagree on the logistics (which are significant, don't get me wrong).\n\n>\u00a0It's important to note that 800 years ago is the most recent comment ancestor for virtually all humans (other than uncontacted tribes, or other similarly isolationist communities).\n\nIt is less the genetic similarity that is of significance to me, more the (if you can't tell) continuity of behavior and institution, as well as cumulative exploitation (for lack of a better term). In a certain sense (that I believe is relevant here) \"France\" still exists as an entity in such a way that it owes a debt to \"Haiti\" which is a entity that has been in continuous existence and incurring harm. This is of course based on fictions- legal, cultural, historical and geopolitical, but ones that are of consequence regardless.\n\n>Nations are not moral actors. Their choices and sense of morality changes with each administration.\u00a0\n\nI agree with you completely on one level: whatever existence a nation has separate from its individual citizens is not \"real\" in the same way a rock or bird or even a photon is. But the idea of a nation is, almost trivially, one that changes the world in ways that the distinction doesn't really matter. Applying moral arguments for nations is a similar type of thing- we're basically participating in a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma and rewarding or punishing cooperation, thus we should act as if nations are capable of moral behavior, both for our own interests and because the constitute members are capable of moral behavior.\n\nAbstract and semantic, admittedly, but useful?\n\n>Haiti deserves help not because they were victimized 200 years ago, but because they are struggling right now.\n\nHere we agree completely. I do not care how it is enacted, but Haiti \"should\" be helped, both because that's \"good\" in some sense of the word *and*because it is in my own interest to do so, suitably expanded. If that happens because of moral weight and as part of a retribution for past behavior, fine, if not, also fine. As long as it happens.",

You're right that it would seem that each French successor state did take payment until 1888. And you're probably right that if that successor state took payment, they'd have more culpability than if they didn't. \n\n>Long story short: yes.

If that takes the form of reparations to Haiti (in part) that is fine.\n\nI haven't quite decided if I agree with you here or not, but that's besides the point.  I'd wager the reason you feel that way *isn't* because of a historical injustice to those nations, but because they *currently* are significantly less wealthy and prosperous than the current Western States. \n\nStill even if it was deciding that giving wealth was the correct moral thing to do. There is a giant question on the logistics of such a task so that corrupt governments and corrupt institutions and corrupt individuals are not significantly propped up. Foreign aid often does cause problems to developing nations especially when propped up for significant periods of time. \"Teach a man to fish\" and all that. But that is more beside the point. \n\n>Applying moral arguments for nations is a similar type of thing- we're basically participating in a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma and rewarding or punishing cooperation, thus we should act as if nations are capable of moral behavior\n\nI don't think that making moral arguments are likely to change a nation's direction, but I don't think it's immoral on an individual level to pressure governments to help the Haitian situation, but I also don't think guilting nations will be an effective way of encouraging payments.

Your argument seems to require that their status as developed economies depends upon historical exploitation, but that's just ahistorical.\n\nIt's quite credible for both governments and populations to argue that they enjoy a developed status today just as much in-spite of their empires than because of it. You could certainly disagree with that, but it then devolves into an empirical question about the extend of current benefit and degree. Generally I find this unsatisfying, since if reparations are \\*morally necessary\\*, it feels like it should derive from facts about the acts in question, not accidents about how well governed countries happened to be subsequently.\n\nAnd if the basis is just 'modern persons continue to benefit', then should Arab states pay reparations for the European slave trade that captures and sold millions? If not, why not? Are they not better off than they otherwise would have been if they had not had advanced slave states?\n\nShould British nationals that are the descendants of enslaved peoples also pay into those reparations? They benefit now. Should poor British people pay to wealthy states such as Canada?\n\nIn moral philosophy you often take a principal that seems intuitive (such as, it's ok to kill if it saves more lives), and then you test it by looking at cases where that rule seems to fail our intuition. My opinion is that the emotional draw of *being able to correct* the sins of the past is blinding too many people to the contradictions and negative outcomes of the moral principle being espoused.\n\nIn this case, I believe reparations are well intentioned but intellectually incoherent. Much much more compelling to argue that developed nations have a duty to maximise welfare in the world and then argue about how that might be done. Asking modern taxpayers to sign up to guilt along with their charity is a pretty good way to ensure that you get neither acceptance nor support for the desperate.",

They assume the empire was the cause, British wealth was the effect. But that's actually backwards. Britain was fabulously wealthy because they were the first nation to industrialize and the first to begin liberalizing their domestic economy, and this vast wealth and production capacity is what enabled the expensive expansion and maintenance of such a large empire.",

From that we say that modern enjoyment of the benefits of historical ills implies some recompense required towards the current descendants of the Indians  impacted. \n\nConsider the issues:\n\nFirstly, that creates a contingency that we might not like. Many modern states are wealthier than Britain. If I could demonstrate empirically that the empire caused Britain to end up less well off than might otherwise been the case, would we be happy to say Britain owes *nothing* to the world because it didn\u2019t benefit from empire? It feels like moral arguments ought not to depend so continently on empirical facts like this. \n\nSecondly, it reduces the benefit that British payments to developed countries might have. Many British colonies (eg Canada) are wealthy, many are rapidly becoming superpowers (eg India). British payments to these states would cannibalise funds that could be made available to the very poorest in the world to whom Britain has no colonial link. In a real sense the focus on \u2018correcting\u2019 historic issues instead perpetuates issues today instead.  \n\nThirdly, it creates outcomes we\u2019d likely find unpalatable. For example, do we require payments from modern Arab states to wealthy European states for the Arab slave trade? Certainly these states pass the test of current inhabitants enjoying benefits directly accruing from that trade. Or should modern Italians pay me (a Scot) for the actions of the legions that greatly harmed the inhabitants of then-Scotland (who were then, most likely, wiped out by new incomes that I am more likely descended from)\n\nFourthly, if we imagine a very great injustice, but whereby the successor state is no longer \u2018enjoying the benefits\u2019, does that remove the moral obligation? For example, if Britain was dreadfully mismanaged (not a great stretch of the imagination), it could become much poorer such that no benefit is enjoyed by modern British taxpayers. Does this subsequent mismanagement of their accrued benefit remove the obligation?\n\nAnd I could go on. I think it\u2019s too morally ambiguous to ever work. We simply cannot fix the past by effort today. \n\nThat\u2019s why I argue a better position is to argue for maximal good today and into the future, instead of a focus on a subset of the sins of the past which are now well past our ability to change",

Stay with the facts. \n\nHaiti paid over 150 francs before inflations adjustments. France called it reparations, it money directly related to the growth of France during very critical times of trade and government. \nHaiti is the only country in the world to have been created by forcibly displaced people. The time it takes to learn the land and develop a system of governing could have been offset by the fact that they had the most valuable trade asset, Sugar at the time. \nLastly, they were sabotaged due to them being the first example of a successful slave revolt in a pro slave owning world. \n\nOne more, 1947 is not that long ago . To have paid France for so long yet recent, suggests France repaying reparations can and should reverse Haiti\u2019s course the same way Haiti did for France in the 1800s during their revolutions.",
