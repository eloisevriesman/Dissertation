The speaker sets the agenda and decides what bills to bring to the floor for a vote.\n* Aside from a couple niche exceptions, that means the GOP has the power to only vote on bills it wants to pass \u2014 it's pretty rare to see a majority put up a bill they *don't* want to pass, unless they are absolutely sure it will fail anyway.\n\nThey only need to win by 1, so the relevant question isn't \"how many more votes do they have in absolute terms?\" It is: \"how close are they to *not* being able to win by 1 anymore?\" \n\nA single flip from yes to no actually shifts the tally by 2, since you're subtracting from one side and adding to the other.

If a person is not a member of the house, being selected as speaker would not fulfill the constitutional requirements for becoming a member of the House, therefore it stands to reason they would also not receive any of the privileges of membership such as voting.\n\n>The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.",
