            "body": "In my opinion, the best argument for right to disconnect laws would be found in the very nature of employment agreements. An employment agreement, in the simplest terms, is an agreement between two parties, in which one party agrees to a particular kind of work and commitment of a particular amount of time, while the other party agrees to provide compensation for that work and time. The work, time, and compensation should all be as clearly defined as possible. If the employee does not have a right to disconnect, then that means that the time commitment required by the job is not clearly defined, and the employee is not able to properly gauge what level of compensation is commensurate to the nature of the job.",

I am salaried, not hourly, and I have coworkers around the world. We have a policy of expecting people to protect their own time and disconnect themselves when they don't want to be contacted. This works great imo. If I'm sitting around at home and think of something, i can send it. If you're interested you can read it. If you aren't, you'll read it when you reconnect. As long as people are getting their jobs done we don't much care. \n\nI realize the situation is different for people working hourly or in the kind of job that is primarily about cranking through a backlog of tasks that aren't particularly creative, but that's kind of the point.",

If the employer and employee aren't clear from the beginning regarding expectations for the employee's availability outside the standard office hours, then there is often a creeping effect, where works starts to gradually intrude more and more into the employee's personal life. And by the time the employee realizes that they need to establish firmer boundaries, they are already in a position where doing so will mean coming off as uncommitted or not willing to be a team player or some other nonsense.",

I just don't know if there's enough incentive for employers to do this voluntarily, especially for lower wage work. As with most labor law issues, it boils down to how much trust to give to employers vs. how much to aid workers with the arm of the law. Workers often find themselves with very little bargaining power compared to employers, so I tend to generally be in favor of laws that, in my view, tip the power scales towards a better balance between employees and employers.",
