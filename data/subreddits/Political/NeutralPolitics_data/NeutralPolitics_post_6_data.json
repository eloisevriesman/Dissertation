            "body": "1. The wall has [flood gates](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N3AC241/) that must be kept open during the wet seasons due to flooding. Otherwise, buildup of debris risks destroying the wall.\n\n2. The wall actually divides [private property](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/17/texas-border-wall-landowner/) in the US, so there are additional gates that are kept open so private landowners can access their property on the other side of the wall.\n\n3. This one I\u2019m not 100% certain of, but migrants only need to be on US soil to claim asylum. Since the border wall is built on US territory and *not* directly on the border, migrants would legally be able to claim asylum without crossing the wall in theory. Pretty sure this is why Texas installed those floating death traps in the Rio Grand.\n\n4. Maintaining a 2,000 mile long wall isn\u2019t feasible. The wall is [breached more than 10 times per day](https://www.cato.org/blog/border-wall-was-breached-11-times-day-2022-2) as of 2022 numbers. That is to say that the CBP finds sections of the wall cut out nearly a dozen times per day. This includes a section [large enough that migrants drove vehicles thru the wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbsgA615lo) at one point.\n\nClearly not effective and not sustainable IMO.",

It took them 3.5 years to complete the 60km section. They have spent an average of 240 million dollars a year in maintaining it since 2014.\n\nIf the US is willing to put that type of investment into a fortification on the border, and willing to actually shoot trespassers on sight, then sure it could work I guess. \n\nIsrael is also, despite the cost and measures taken to make the wall unbreachable, increasing the active manning of it in light of the october breach.\n\n[https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2023/10/11/The-Iron-Wall-What-is-the-Gaza-Israel-fence-](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2023/10/11/The-Iron-Wall-What-is-the-Gaza-Israel-fence-)\n\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/on-both-sides-of-gazas-border-the-idf-is-remaking-security-from-the-underground-up/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/on-both-sides-of-gazas-border-the-idf-is-remaking-security-from-the-underground-up/)\n\n[https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/rapid-proliferation-number-border-walls](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/rapid-proliferation-number-border-walls)",

            "body": "I think almost all of the available evidence shows that modern border walls are incredibly successful at significantly impacting and lowering illegal immigration across the board. Most of the counterexamples I've seen are by critics who point out walls that are either undermanned or underfunded, or don't have reliable data.\n\nIn contrast, if you look at some of the most successful border walls, they decrease illegal immigration by 90%+\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\\_West\\_Bank\\_barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian\\_border\\_barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_border_barrier)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria%E2%80%93Turkey\\_barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria%E2%80%93Turkey_barrier)\n\n[https://globalchallenges.ch/figure/fact-sheet-the-israeli-west-bank-barrier/](https://globalchallenges.ch/figure/fact-sheet-the-israeli-west-bank-barrier/)\n\nSpecifically looking at Israel's west bank barrier, it has been incredibly effective at lowering illegal immigration by 90%+, and cost a fraction of what it would cost the US in terms of a percentage of GDP to solve such a large issue. \n\nIndeed, even when the US has tried putting up barriers in certain areas those areas are avoided by illegal immigrants, per historical research.\n\n[https://econ.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/283/2020/06/Fenced\\_Out\\_0622\\_2020.pdf](https://econ.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/283/2020/06/Fenced_Out_0622_2020.pdf)\n\nThe fact is, most of the arguments against the effectiveness of a border wall are derived from conjecture and \"what if\" scenarios, not from real, recent historical data. \n\nWith the use of modern technology like infrared lighting to detect large groups of people, border walls would be incredibly helpful to CBP in funneling large groups of migrants to certain areas (As people have mentioned, areas of the wall that are constantly attacked and destroyed with tools). Even the CBP agents on the ground support a wall. \n\n[https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/video-gallery/video-library/walls-work](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/video-gallery/video-library/walls-work)\n\nAgain, the goal isn't to completely stop illegal immigration- it's to significantly decrease illegal crossings. Through the use of politics to dissuade potential crossers, physical barriers to physically stop or slow large groups, and technologically-empowered CBP, the border crisis can be easily properly addressed- it's just about getting the support to put out the resources to do so.",

How about Hungary, Syria-Turkey, and the West Bank? Is there similar evidence?",

But a full wall across the entire southern border with proper maintenance and staffing is going to be a hell of a lot more expensive than whatever we have now.\n\nAnd it will require a massive hiring increase for border patrol guards, massive urban planning,  architecture, and engineering effort. You have to plan routes for estimated migrant crossing flow, set up safe entry points, increased volume of legal services, maintain the wall in a variety of climates and terrains. And all of this across 2000 miles. This would be an unprecedented effort and would require buy-in from multiple executive agencies coordinating together.\n\nYou have to coordinate the DoJ, DoHS, DoI, and more. You have to make sure the ecological impact is negligible, no concerns for endangered wildlife, proper emergency service availability, legal challenges in every state, etc.\n\nIt would be a bureaucratic challenge at minimum, and isn\u2019t a problem that can be solved really by saying \u201cjust throw more money at it\u201d.

Of course the government would have to work with the states- they already do so on a daily basis. All the services you\u2019ve mentioned already work with the states to deal with the current border crisis, and they\u2019ve had to work overtime since we have unprecedented illegal immigration crossings into the US. \n\nWith a modern border wall you\u2019d have far less crossings, more control over who enters the country, and at the end of the day you\u2019d probably have far less border guards- since crossings will be funneled into high traffic areas, CBP will be able to concentrate on a few high traffic areas, rather than overseeing thousands of miles of un-barricaded land.",

[People crossing the border without authorization \"typically\" wait to be apprehended and indicate they are seeking asylum](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/), at which point a large fraction of them are released for legal temporary residence in the US for the duration of their asylum review process. That duration is years because the process has a backlog of three million cases. If asylum is approved, people who entered the country without authorization become legal immigrants; if not, they are ordered to be deported.\n\nSo by preventing illegal crossings, a border wall would effectively block both legal and illegal immigration. Another view of the issue would be: why is it so difficult for refugees to enter the country legally that they'll risk their lives and cross the border illegally just to apply for asylum? Or, why is the asylum process so slow that migrants without valid refugee claims will risk their lives and cross the border illegally just to live in America for a few years, or use that time to disappear? Or, why is it so hard to immigrate legally that anyone would abuse the asylum system in the first place?",

So asylum request is indeed a \"typical\" next step after unauthorized border crossing.\n\n> A border wall wouldn't preclude people from using Ports of Entry to apply for asylum. \n\nHere we're on the same page: what force is pushing asylum seekers away from legal ports of entry more strongly than the wall is pushing them there?",

Summary**\n\nFrom the research below, my conclusion is that objectors to border walls are not basing their objections on the efficacy of border fences which have proven extremely effective when manned. Manned should be understood as a euphemism to mean \"when combined with the use of physical force or violence to repel illegal immigrants\".\n\n**II. Factual Analysis**\n\nBorder walls have proven extremely effective when manned, as can be summarized from the available authoritative studies from the extreme difficulty of individuals crossing the Berlin Wall during the Cold War, to the extreme reduction in net-illegal migration from Morocco to Spain from the construction of the Cuerta wall (and its later doubling in size). Edina Lilla Meszaros, [Barbed Wire, Border Walls and the 'Art' of Fencing out Migrants and Refugees: An Assessment of the EU and American Bordering Practices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3489076), 18 RES. & SCI. TODAY 75, at 78, 82 (2019).\n\n**Cueta Fence and Walls Severely Dropped Morocco to Spain Immigration.**\n\nThe Cueta \"fences met the expectations of their builders, as from 2005 until 2013/2014 they have managed to keep away major flows of immigrants, instead forcing them to choose more perilous routes through the sea.\" *Id*. These fences were reinforced in 2005, manned by agents with thermal goggles, CCTV, and other devices. *Id*. Most immigrants did not choose sea travel because its perilous nature so they remain where they are. *Id*.\n\nHowever, while the wall was extremely effective, attempts at breakthrough ended in death and western nations have developed a policy against killing illegal immigrants, thus Spain modified its side of the wall to remove a layer of razor wire, increase height of less dangerous parts of the wall to more safely deter immigration *Id*. at 84. However, Morocco put up the Razorwire on its side of the wall, using money granted to it by the EU. *Id*.\n\n**Hungarian/EU Border Fences Severely Dropped Immigration from 764,033 in 2015 to 5,869 in 2018.**\n\nIn 2015 there was an extreme rise of migration into the EU from the Western Balkans Route. *Id*. at 83. Hungary received \"174,400 first time asylum applications\" but only determined that \"545\" claims were valid, that almost all were economic migrants. *Id*. Germany received 441,800 asylum applications, but with its much laxer standards at the time, admitted 148,215 qualified, but over two thirds were baseless. *Id*.\n\nIn response to the influx of \"economic migrants who came to Europe for financial benefits\", Hungary, Germany, Austria, Greece, and Macedonia all built border walls and nations adopted policy changes to Asylum procedures and Criminal Codes to deter immigration. *Id*. at 84-85. Illegal immigration along that route is down to 5,869 as of 2018. *Id*.\n\n**Excellent Study Shows Usage and Effects of Walls**\n\nDavid B. Carter & Paul Poast, [Why Do States Build Walls? Political Economy, Security, and Border Stability](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26363882), 61 J. CONFLICT RESOL. 239 (2017) is an extremely good read on this subject. Largely, we see walls for either military reasons or when a wealthier nation borders a poorer nation. There are border walls in every continent except South America, and there is a really cool table spanning pages 249-250 that shows all of the various walls built by different nations. The authors, like the author of the previous studies, critique human cost of walls.\n\nBut they do not challenge their effectiveness.",

Because EVerify is not used, employers of illegal immigrants get a workforce they can exploit and expose to danger, such as the current milkbourne virus H5N1. *Id*. They also lower wages for lower skilled employees. *Id*. It is more attractive to come to the US because people can actually work here once they get in, even if the conditions are awful.\n\n**IV. Conclusion**\n\nWalls are effective when they are manned and properly. The better arguments against walls focus on human rights angles or globalism as a desirable philosophy. There is strong evidence that walls combined with physical force are a deterrent.",

Given the US stopped giving free stuff to people who break the law, there would be a lot less to deal with on the Illegal immigration issue.  In the 1990's, a lot of the illegal immigrant issues were due to migrant workers not going home.  The situation has become worse.\n\n*Plyler v. Doe*Plyler v. Doe, for example, allowed for Illegal Immigrant children to receive US public education.  That was back in 1982.  Given people didn't feel comfortable, in the US, after breaking the law, many of them would not be in the US.\n\nThe Law, that is immigration law, it is not handled the same for everyone.  Given someone came here on a student visa, they wouldn't get away with a lot of the stuff people arriving, lately, from South America have been getting away with.\n\nLink: [When Might I be Deported as Foreign Student in the US](https://www.devorelawgroup.com/when-might-i-be-deported-as-a-foreign-student-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=These%20deported%20students%20now%20face%20a%20five-year%20visa,to%20enter%20the%20United%20States%20in%20the%20future) from Devore Law Group\n\nAre certain Universities not giving scholarships to Illegal Immigrants like Obama and his Dream Act?  Free stuff to law breakers.  Not applied evenly.",
