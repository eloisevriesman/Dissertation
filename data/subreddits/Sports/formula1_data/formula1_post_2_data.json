DKR suffers from some issues with loose narrative threads and while it looks good, its shots lack a lot of the depth work Nolan is known for. He really got a chance to make a banger film and not rely so much on the minutia. I think of them as both great meals but the DKR is the top meal at a medium priced steakhouse, the DK is a mid tier meal at the nicer steakhouse. Similar thing but theres a certain craftsmanship that went into the DK that wasn't required in the DKR",
