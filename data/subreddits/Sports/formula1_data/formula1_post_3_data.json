Probably either cut resin or acrylic. \n\nNo chance any movie advertising budget would A. Pay Jaguar to put sponsors all over an F1 car while also B. Providing two matching 250,000 dollar diamonds to be on both cars.",

One of which is far more likely.\n\nIt was replaced pre-race with a shoddy replica that just fell off at one point because it wasn't secured on properly. Although this would likely require someone knowing the diamond would be on the car well ahead to get a somewhat matching piece. Which likely makes this unlikely.\n\nThe more common explanation is that it just fell of sometimes during the race and was pocketed by someone or even just straight up destroyed. The car was in a crash wasn't it?\n\nEven if it wasn't real the 2nd thing makes just as much sense.",

With gold we also decided its expensive so it is, but you can sell your used good for decent price, diamond barely gets you anything because thats how worthless most diamonds actually are. Diamonds are only worth much in very specific scientific uses (most uses need only cheap stuff) or because prestigious company sells you a diamond and people pay for it. \n\nSo maybe they just got a diamond cheaply somehow, then after race wanted to sell \"race run\" diamond for massive price. So its lost opportunity, but they did not necessarily pay much for the diamond.",

Something might be inherently valuable because of scarcity but even that doesn't always relatie to the monetary expensiveness of it. \n\nYou said it yourself that gold is only expensive because we like it. Same as money, it's literally worth much more than the paper it's written on in many cases. So what you're suggesting, that they \"somehow\" got a diamond for cheap, reeks like suggesting that they \"somehow\" got money for less than the value of the money.
