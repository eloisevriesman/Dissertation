Say it's Q3, Sainz goes out for his first flying lap, sets a tremendous time, pole, banger of a lap. Everyone goes back to the garages, come out, time for the last flying lap of the season. Oh, what's this? Manhole cover outta nowhere! Bam, Sainz is out, red flag because his car sucked a magnet. Now, he didn't get to set a second lap. But no one else did, and his previous lap put him on pole. Therefore, getting taken out by the manhole cover is not a penalty, because he is already on pole and now no one else can be. So he isn't penalized, as you're saying he would be in this hypothetical scenario. But because of the rules, his time needs to be wiped, because his car brought out the red flag. But it wasn't his fault at all. The people responsible for making the circuit safe were numbskulls, and Sainz just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Therefore, completely blameless, and so deleting his time would be a complete injustice.\n\nAnyways, this is the scenario the other person is trying to make you see. I personally don't think it would be a problem so long as it was written in the rules that some circumstances completely and entirely outside of any driver's or team's control would exempt them from the penalty for bringing out a red flag. Because sometimes shit just happens and punishing someone for no reason would just make people sour on what would be an otherwise positive rule. I'd love to see the yellow/red flag rule in F1.",
