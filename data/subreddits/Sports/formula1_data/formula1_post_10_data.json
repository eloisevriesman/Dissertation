            "body": "Tldr; Sergio Perez aims to perform well in Monaco, where he won in 2022. Despite some challenges in Italy, his season start has been satisfactory, according to Helmut Marko of Red Bull, who confirmed Perez as the top choice for a 2025 contract. An extension for Perez could impact other drivers' moves, with Carlos Sainz likely considering Audi over Mercedes. Rumors also suggest Yuki Tsunoda might seek opportunities outside of Red Bull due to limited advancement prospects.",

            "body": "\n\n# Red Bull also wants Sergio Perez for 2025: \u2018He is our first choice\u2019\n\n>Ahead of the Monaco Grand Prix, the driver carousel in Formula 1 is once again a big topic. Red Bull Racing wants to make a decision before the summer break.\n\n>After his underwhelming performance in Imola, Sergio Perez wants to have his say again in Monaco. The Mexican won the race in 2022 and definitely feels at home on the street circuit. Despite the turbulence in Italy, Perez does not need to put himself under any pressure this season, as the number two's start to the season was absolutely satisfactory for Red Bull, says Helmut Marko. That is why Perez is also the first choice for the second cockpit at Red Bull Racing for the 2025 season, the motorsport consultant revealed ahead of the Monaco Grand Prix. \u2018Talks are ongoing and Checo is still our first option. We want to have clarity on this before the summer break, although we are certainly not putting ourselves under any pressure.\u2019\n\n>A contract extension for the Mexican could set the famous ball rolling. Should Perez sign with Red Bull, a highly coveted position in the driver line-up would be lost. Carlos Sainz would then probably only have the option of joining Mercedes or Sauber. At the Silver Arrows, however, the Spaniard would probably only be offered a short-term contract. It therefore seems increasingly likely that the three-time GP winner will opt for the long-term and lucrative offer from Audi and drive alongside Nico H\u00fclkenberg at Sauber next season before Audi takes over the racing team as the works team from 2026.\n\n>\n\n>Recently, rumours of Yuki Tsunoda's departure have also repeatedly surfaced. According to media reports, the Japanese driver is rumoured to be looking around as he does not see any opportunities for promotion at the Bulls. \u2018He is of course also part of the talks,\u2019 reassures Marko, who thinks a lot of the Japanese player. \u2018In general, we have several options in his contract to tie him down for several years.\u2019\n\n\n\n(Tranlated with [Deepl)](https://www.deepl.com/translator)",

It was a very close fight between two drivers on the same level.  \n  \nBottas also has 10 wins, 20 poles and 58 podiums in his 5 years at Merc, while so far Perez has 5 wins, 3 poles and 29 podiums in his 3.25 years at RB.  \nBottas had the undisputed fastest car with no challengers for 1,5 seasons (in 2017 and 2018 Ferrari was equally fast, 2019 Merc was dominant for half the season, 2020 the whole season, 2021 RB was equally fast), while Perez already has 1,5 seasons in the undisputed fastest car (2023 and the second half of 2022).  \nIf you are talking about consistency, Bottas had a streak of 103 consecutive Q3 appearances, while Perez needs a recovery drive what feels like every 3rd race.\n  \n  \nYes, Bottas also had pretty bad races every so often, but Perez didn't even manage to get *half* of the points of Verstappen last season, while driving in one of the most dominant cars of all time.",

Perez is not on the level of the other drivers in the top cars and if they get close enough his position will start falling fast even if he\u2019s not particularly underperforming.\n\nIt\u2019ll be very interesting to see whether red bull go back to dominating in the next few races, or if keeping Perez as their no.2 seems like it will hurt their chances at constructors",

Maybe this year too, although hopefully McLaren can get in the mix).\n\nMerc domination was at least somewhat interesting from 14-16 due to Ros/Ham, so I'd like something at least close to that.
