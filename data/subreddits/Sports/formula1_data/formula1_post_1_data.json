They're obviously struggling to keep up with the top 4 teams, but they're still comfortably 5th - and they were not prior to 23. I think the beginning of last season was obviously them overperforming, and the team decided to run with it and be overly optimistic instead of saying \"yeah this won't last\" which is understandable. \n\nI think what will be more interesting for AM is 26, as that will be the true test of how capable they are of being a front running team.",

McLaren and Ferrari are keeping their tyres nice and healthy and we can see that the overall race time gap is getting shorter.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMercedes seem to be in a gap now as Aston Martin is seemingly going backwards again. Good on Stroll for a solid drive and got into a good position to pick up P9.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBoth VCarbs despite showing raw pace, couldn't keep up in the race, also to blame on the early stops to ruin their pace in the second stint.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBummer for Hulk to just miss out on the points, but overall Haas are peeking for points with Kevin also neatly finishing behind Hulk.\u00a0\n\n\nThe other backmarkers have their work to do to be able to get close to points. Looking pretty hopeless for them if nothing weird happens in the top.",

            "body": "Well that was unexpectedly thrilling.\n\nImola is a track I can appreciate from a technical standpoint, but it's not the easiest to overtake round there and most of the ones that did happen were through strategy - drivers being overcut/undercut or people on fresher tyres getting by. If it was dropped in order to make way for another classic circuit - Hockenheim or Istanbul, for example - I wouldn't complain.\n\nFerrari were solid. Not the best with strategy, but the race pace was there. McLaren - well I thought they could fight, but after Max kept the lead I didn't expect there to be a close battle. Seems like Red Bull's struggles early in the weekend were real - that was Max extracting all he could out of the car to get the pole and the win when it wasn't playing ball. Finally, we got to see Lando hunting him down on track for the lead, but experience and a slight pace advantage won out eventually. It was close for Lando, though. Were it on a circuit where overtaking is slightly easier, more DRS zones, he could have had him. Nice work McLaren, more points gained in the constructors and they make gains on both Red Bull and Ferrari. I feel like Checo's having his European leg form from last season, and while that might have been OK last year with Max basically running away with it, with McLaren and Ferrari now starting to breathe down Red Bull's necks and Newey leaving the team, they need to make sure two drivers are consistent. Keep an eye on that, the constructors' may not be already decided if Checo has off days and the team behind keep getting good points every weekend, especially now McLaren have a car that can fight for the win and hopefully Ferrari as well. \n\nOn to Monaco then, and let's hope McLaren can go one step better in qualifying and get pole - and watch out for Leclerc as well at his home race. We might be in for a more exciting season than lots of people predicted",

This and Miami last time out confirms that McLaren have serious race pace  The gap has gotten smaller at the front.\n\nDespite that, the race was a bit of a chore. Typical Imola fare but it paid some dividends at the end. Not only with Norris, but also the only strategy variance of short stint v long stint came into play heavily for the latter.  Fantastic race Stroll and Magnussen, who managed 40 lap mediums to gain serious position. Stroll with some good points for his efforts well done. Magnussen will rue his qualifying results, although yesterday he was impeded.\n\nOvertaking should be difficult but this track doesn't strike the happy balance for open wheel racing. The F2 sprint yesterday another good example (haven't watched the feature yet). The \"new\" (not relatively) layout just not fantastic for open wheel cars. Great for sportscars though.\n\nOnwards to Monaco. Best qualifying of the season and it is next weekend. Win-win!",

Credit to AM for holding their nerve with the strategy, which looked very suspect midway through the race.\n\nRough rough day for Perez and Alonso. Not sure where the pace was for either of them.\n\nNot sure what else there is to say. Merc still worse than the top 3. Alpine aren't plum last anymore.

So it may have not got the tires into the correct window to start sector 1 of what should\u2019ve been his fastest lap. At the same time, Checo didn\u2019t get the greatest launch in that sense either, but Max did because they got him out there in a decent place.

Red Bull were shit AF.\n\nNo they weren't.\n\nPretty much Max doing decent times but fucking up a specific sequence of corners and his complaint is, if I brake late it bottoms out and I can't turn in. Surprise, he braked a little earlier and got pole because you know, the car was fast. he was pushing over the limit and kept fucking up the laps, that's how that happens. Fucking up a corner because you were taking too much doesn't mean the car was shit, or slow, or even had a problem. he was just trying to take too much in one corner, as soon as he stopped doing that... pole.\n\nFastest car and quiet easily... calling it a shit car because you fundamentally don't understand that free practice literally exists so the drivers can find the limits for every corner is, embarrassing.",

Ground work is laid for a great 3 way battle for wins. \n\nWho knows where the old car would have been, maybe back with the Mercedes vs where they are now.",
