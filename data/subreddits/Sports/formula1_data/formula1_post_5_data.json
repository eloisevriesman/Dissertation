Which would give him one year to show what he is made of. If he beats Albon and scores good points in that *\\*upper midfield car\\*,* he may find another chance in a top team.",

He's improved his racecraft a lot since joining Ferrari and there are plenty teams that could see him as an asset for at least until the 2030s.\n\nHe could return to Ferrari once Lewis retires or Aston once Alonso retires. Red Bull could also open at somepoint and be an in for him. Mercedes could even open if Russell or Antonelli move on.\n\nI don't *really* see why Williams makes more sense than Audi looking from an investment level, but trusting Mercedes engines is a solid idea in theory so I get it",

He's at his peak and he deserves to be fighting in a good car alongside another good driver. But if he can't do that I wish he would take the Audi and use that brain to help build a great car around him. \n\nIf Lawrence Stroll didn't love Lance as much as he did he should be pouncing on Sainz.",

The past few German works teams have a pretty decent record of elevating teams including Sauber.\n\nBMW elevated Williams from 5th in the WCC with 3 podiums to 3rd with 3 podiums in a year.

They lack the staff, they lack the facilities and i don't think Dorilton is serious in investing into either of those.\n\nYou are wrong about Williams and Dorilton (I think!). It will take many years but they are committed and have a plan in place. Claire Williams did a podcast recently where she briefly touched on this and the sale of the team (starts around the 21m mark): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UudMP6AMjdY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UudMP6AMjdY)",

His reach in terms of brand value and social media also is a significant boost to a brand like Ferrari and recoups a lot of what he costs.\n\nSainz got booted because Lewis has a bigger rep basically and it doesn't feel right. His on track performances (only 6 points behind Leclerc in 2023, only 2 points behind in 2024 if you exclude Jeddah where he didn't race) absolutely did not warrant being dropped and being stuck in a backmarker team.\n\nAnd I don't care what anyone says, it's just so wrong on Carlos.
