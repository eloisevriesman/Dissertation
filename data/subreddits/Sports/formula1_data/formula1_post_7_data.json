During their working years as an athlete, it\u2019s more natural than not for them to put in full effort. \n\nLewis has also been working with a new core training team since Angela\u2019s departure. these initial transition years are particularly good ones for figuring out how they work together and how to extract the maximum from Lewis every week\u2014because he\u2019s not fighting for a title and has a little more time available. And even if he doesn\u2019t think he can get a win in this year\u2018s Mercedes, why would he want to be soundly beaten by George (who is motivated) in his final season as the team\u2019s senior driver and figurehead? It doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nHe may not be putting every last ounce of capacity toward improving the car or shoring l up the team for next year, but it\u2019s very unlikely. he isn\u2019t still trying to get the most out of himself.\n\nEdited typo",

Giving feedback on the drivebility and set up of the car will not make next years car quick, let alone the car 2 years after. I guess we are also forgetting the whole new powertrain that was introduced in 2014 and is main reason that Mercedes was quick. Unless you think Schumacher was secretly an engineer and one of the best ones at that, how the hell do you figure out he was responsible for the 2014 car?",

No one is saying Michael, or any driver, is in the design room, making CAD schematics, and running CFD simulations. That's the engineering/design team's job. However, the designers can only create something they *think* should be amazing. The drivers then test it and give feedback to help shape the development of the car.\n\nSo if a characteristic of a car is that it isn't predictable in a medium speed corner, but it's fine in high speed and ok in low speed, they know where to focus in development. And then the positive changes they make will carry over to the next car",

            "body": "Translation:\n\nF1 | MERCEDES LOSES MORE... PIECES, BUT CLOSES THE DOOR ON NEWEY\n\nThe Star has probed the possibility of securing the \"genius\" who left Red Bull, but top management chose to give full confidence to James Allison. Mercedes continues to lose important pawns (also leaves Vino chief of aerodynamics). The restart will begin with Resta and Sampo arriving from Maranello.\n\nMercedes is no longer interested in getting Adrian Newey. The time, now, is up. The Star has no intention of waiting for the choices of the English \"genius\" because it intends to go its own way. Toto Wolff is in a very special moment in which the Brackley team is in a phase of full renewal, as if, having finished a cycle full of satisfaction and world titles, the phase has arrived in which it is necessary to build a new cycle.\n\n\n\nThe ebb phase has not yet ended: the exodus of leading figures has not yet ended. Out of the black-and-silver team comes Joachim Vino, head of the aerodynamics department. The Australian, despite his very Italian surname, begins his six-month gardening period after being an important ganglion of the team since 2018. In fact, Giacchino is paying for having headed the aerodynamic group at Brackley since 2022, that is, leading the cycle of three cars (W13, W14, and W15) that, with the ground effect regulation, did not yield the results the Star expected.\n\nJames Allison, who took over last year as technical director in place of Mike Elliott, has failed to provide the turnaround the German brand expected, but everyone acknowledges the British engineer has found himself too lonely in a technical sphere that has literally been plundered over time. Apparently, James was willing to tender his resignation, which was also rejected by the top management of the company, and the future must come through Allison's experience.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Vino, Loic Serra, the Frenchman who will be coming to Maranello from October 1, along with Jerome d'Ambrosio, Toto Wolff's right-hand man who will be Ferrari's vice-team principal, so he will answer only to Fred Vasseur, also left in April. The operation to strengthen the Scuderia comes with the...emptying out of Brackley, but the Mercedes strengthening also starts with the acquisition of two figures from the Cavallino.\n\nIn October, Simone Resta will arrive: the engineer from Imola, who has been Haas' technical director for three years and was not part of Enrico Cardile's plans to keep him away from Sport Management, will be the designer to whom Mercedes will entrust the design of the 2026 single-seater with the new regulations.\n\nThe Star is also banking on Enrico Samp\u00f2, the simulation specialist, an area where Wolff's team seems to have lost some steam: the Italian, in fact, will be head of performance software applications.\n\nMercedes is not putting itself in the upside game of Adrian Newey, who is willing to settle for another team, but without taking on any technical responsibility, preferring a consultant role available two or three days a week, working in out-sourcing and without the obligation to go regularly to the factory.\n\nToto Wolff, then, wants to build a new technical team by looking for resources that can be integrated into a staff that needs to be reformed from the ground up.",

The main cap should encompass, testing, parts, simulation, etc. Let employees get paid what they should be in a fair competitive market. I wouldn't be surprised if the team heads worked with the FIA on the cap so they can reduce their employees salaries even more. It's a play on emotion, \"sorry, we can't give you a raise because then the car would be slower since we couldn't afford xyz, and you wouldn't want that would you? Why are you putting your needs ahead of the 'team'?\"\n\nIt's like an executive driven union agreement and it's a bit sickening honestly.",
