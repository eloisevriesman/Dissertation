And they are pretty sure one of them will take the deal.\n\nAnd I can't blame them, because everyone seems to be more promising than Alpine.\n\nHowever, that same report suggests that both Sainz and Ocon has some objections regarding Audi current progress, and state of Hinwil infrastructure. Possibly there are still things being in active use since BMW times (BMW pulled out in 2009). I could believe that they still use their supercomputer to calculate CFD (famous Albert2, which was one of the most powerful machines back in 2007, but come on - we are already in 2024), and even more - old aero tunnel built in 2002, using McLaren money from buying Raikkonen. It would be like using 1980 aero tunnel in 2002, or using 1990 supercomputer to calculate CFD.\n\nWith that, Audi seems like really unpromising prospect, because their Hinwil base is not the only point of objections. Drivers might be scared that Honda engine history might repeat itself in Audi.\n\nAnd that's why Sainz is trying to get a seat elsewhere, even despite shit ton of money Audi is offering him.",

Of course, VER/LEC are not the same driver and RB/Ferrari not the same team, but again, we are not comparing Red Bull and Williams - it is all very similar.\n\nPerformance against teammates:\n\n* Sainz has beaten Leclerc a few times on merit and been consistently close to him. Looking at the results of the last few seasons, Sainz has mostly been inside a window of 2 places around leclerc with the occasional exception.\n* Perez has never beaten Verstappen without the \"help\" of incidents involving Max. He has mostly been \"close enough\" but not close to Verstappen. Again looking at the results of the last few seasons, Checo's window around verstappen has been more like 3-4 places with more \"outliers\" outside of that window than Sainz.\n\nNow you can argue that Checo has the better teammate, but he also sits in a better car that didn't really have competition from other teams, so I think this comparison is pretty fair.\n\nThis alone in my eyes is enough to explain why Sainz is currently valued higher than Perez, but I give you a few more points why Sainz is better for Audi and Checo better for RB:\n\n* Sainz is younger than Checo. This is both a point for Sainz at Audi and Checo at RB. Audi is looking for someone to build their team with in the mid/long term, while RB want someone safe to warm their seat until some newer talent comes up the ranks. In that case, someone nearing the end of their career is easier to replace and there is not as much of a dilemma\n* RB don't want the best possible driver in the second seat. They want a good 2nd driver. Checo is not especially demanding. Checo knows where he's at. He sits in the best car on the grid and is, all in all, fine with playing the number 2. Sainz, coming from Ferrari, where he competed very well against Leclerc would have more of a mindset of \"I can beat this guy too\", which can lead to a inter team rivalry that RB don't want or need. Checo does his job reasonably well, Verstappen does the rest, everyone is happy\n* Audi already has a driver that is even more comparable to Perez in Hulk. They are a known quantity together and a very strong midfield lineup, but for Sainz there is more of a chance that he brings something a bit extra to that lineup that elevates it. Not saying that that will be the case, but for Checo you can be pretty sure that it won't whereas for Sainz there is a chance\n\nDoes any of this mean that Sainz will be at Audi or that Perez would be a bad option for them? No. Of course not. But I think it is very reasonable argumentation that I think most people currently agree with.\n\nOh and, btw, Sainz did lead McLaren 2019/20. Lead driver does not mean that you have to win races or championships. It mainly means that you are more often than not the driver with the better results in the team and give it direction as it develops and fights whereever it currently sits in the championship. Checo of course did that too at Racing Point, but everything I said before explains why I think that Sainz would be the better Lead driver option than Perez currently.",

They already have Hulkenberg who\u2019s older. Why would having Perez, who\u2019s also a little older than Sainz plus has several kids as a motivator to retire sooner than later, make any sense? Sainz is also highly ambitious, which is more helpful to Audi and more problematic to Red Bull. \n\nMeanwhile, Red Bull has a young generational talent still under contract till 2028 (though of course we all know he could walk away if he  wanted to). If verstappen left they would have no problem attracting Norris, Piastri, or whoever the next young big thing is for Max\u2019s seat \u2014 plus a #2 they want, like Albon. So Sainz\u2019s presence is really far from essential in either role with the team. At this moment in time they are well established team and don\u2019t need experience/leadership to be the focus for that number two seat. They also don\u2019t want someone whose ambitions could introduce friction. So that leaves being able to do a decent number two job and commercial appeal, both of which Checo can fulfill. Plus, the fact that they can probably get Checo to agree to a shorter term deal than Sainz is likely attractive to Red Bull.",

I'm sorry but if he was racing at a top team today his qualifying record would not be one season long, let alone 5. \n\nBefore the cost cap was introduced and actually started working, the gaps were massive. To qualify outside of top 10, Bottas would need a performance bad enough to right now 100% put him in last place. Just compare quali gaps season by season, let's take Silverstone as an example - always in the calendar, medium length, and teams have their cars sorted by then if at all:\n\nIn 2017 P1 to P10 was 2.9s. In 2018 2.3 s. In 2019 1.4 seconds. 2020 had 2 races - 1.7 seconds and 2.0s. \n\nThe gaps only started going down in 2021, and by 2022 Bottas was gone.\n\nLast year P1 to P10 was 0.9 seconds.\n\nHis record is impressive in that he didn't even crash once in quali for 5 years, I guess that's something. The problem with it is the gaps. Perez fell out of Q3 in Imola because he was half a second behind Max. Being half a second off the leader would often still put Bottas in P2 in some races. In pretty much every single one it would put him top 6 at worst. And to be out in Q2, he would need, as I said, a gap equivalent to what these days puts a driver on the last row. \n\nUnless he crashed or had a technical issue it was basically impossible to not get into Q3.",

Not to mention the speculation on F1 gossip Instagrams and forums that the Sainz still play media games to this day.\n\nHis politicking don't even have to work inside the team: if/when Max beats him, all he and his team would have to do is go to the media and imply Redbull are sabotaging him, aren't treating him equally, etc. We all know what F1 media is like and what they'd do. I think a similar narrative has mostly calmed down with Checo, but I remember last year, there were so many comments on Redbull's Instagram accusing them of giving Checo a slower car, etc. The higher ups at Redbull very likely know things that we don't that justifies their reluctance",

If a driver has serious WDC aspirations and goals, which Carlos seems to have, they probably think  they're the best driver and that they just need the best car. As Max himself has said, he thinks every driver should believe they're the best-otherwise it's better to stay at home. \n\nAnd I *really* doubt they'll accept that Max is the first driver. There were rumours that when Carlos struggled in 2022, his team politicked with Binotto, leading to the latter favouring Carlos and even steering car development towards his preferences. This allegedly contributed to Charles' unhappiness and ultimatum back then. Carlos' mom even liked a Tweet after Monza 2023 that declared Charles had no honour. (And according to Kym Illman and contrary to Ferrari's PR,  Charles and Carlos don't exactly get on very well at the moment). There's also still speculation among gossip pages and forums that the Sainz's media games are still alive and well.\n\nNow imagine what's going to happen when Max refuses team orders. If/when Max beats Carlos. All it'd take to cause drama is for them to go to the media, to save face, and plant the seeds that Carlos is being given a slower car and whatnot. F1 media will F1 media. I think it'd be just as messy\u2013if not even messier. I'm sure Redbull has way more insider information than we do",

Lando had on theory an offer from RBR and he rejected it\u2026 he knew if he took it, he would need to overcome Verstappen on that team, while they push Max #1 driver since the first moment. It would be difficult, not to speak of the time needed to adapt to a new car and so on.",

Yes, Sainz has developed since then but still I reckon it'd be close between them. \n\nHulk can perform to the cars ability very consistently, his only downside is that when there's been chaotic grand prix's he hasn't capitalised on a podium either through poor luck or mistakes but its not like hes ever had a consistent podium car. Hes always needed an element of luck to potentially get those result.\n\nHowever, a season isn't really built on chaotic results, throughout a season Hulk is very competent and would keep Sainz honest. All it would take is an unstable car like they had at Renault and then Hulk could easily beat him, a more stable car then I put it more on Sainz's side.",

That was the general perception, I don\u2019t recall anyone mentioning him being in a slump. For Ocon to be a tenth off Alonso in 2022 was pretty commendable. \n\nSainz is also a very good driver but lacks that final tenth to be really elite which is why I\u2019d put Ocon and Sainz in a very similar category. Both very good drivers who could cause the top guys some serious challenges but over the course of a season, ultimately they don\u2019t have the pace consistency that the elite do.",

Both Carlos and Max's teams are still playing politics (like with Binotto (allegedly) & the Christian Horner drama) so unlike what a lot of people think... I think it'd get really ugly if/when Max beats Carlos (and refuses team orders). Redbull know that. More team drama is the *last* thing Redbull wants after their civil war a few months ago. Checo isn't just stable and cooperative, he also brings in big sponsorship money and a huge loyal fanbase. \n\nCarlos isn't an excellent second driver because he doesn't want to be a second driver and he doesn't see himself as one. He sees himself as a future champion. If/when Max beats him, all he and his team would have to do is go to the media and plant the seeds that Redbull is giving him a slower car, etc. Carlos' mom, after the Ferrari scrap at Monza, even liked a Tweet accusing Charles of having no honour. I can only imagine what they'd do if/when Max refuses team orders in Carlos' favour.\n\nAnd there's still the uncertainty of whether Carlos would actually do better than Checo. He prefers understeer and the Redbull is notoriously oversteery. There's a lot of uncertainties and risks with signing Carlos, so I get their reluctance. Of course there's also a risk to the WCC with keeping Checo on if he has another slump during the European leg",

That will most likely not have changed much over the years. \n\nthe other thing is Perez struggles in cars with a more forward balance hence why in 22 and 23 he started the season well when the RB was less on the nose but as they developed the car that changed. That is another thing that is very similar with Sainz. Sainz also doesn't do too well in cars with a more forward balance as we have seen in 22, 23 and most likely saw in Imola too. So there are no guarantees that Sainz would be doing super well in a car that Verstappen likes. In 22 when the Ferrari had the most forward balance he was comparatively nowhere performance wise compared to Leclerc. Similar to the end of 23 with their Suzuka floor upgrade.\n\nand at that point if there is no significant guaranteed increase in performance the question then is a thing of sponsors which Perez has infinitely more than Sainz who currently on his website has none. Plus, Perez is significantly less detrimental to the team harmony because his entourage is much less involved. \n\nso you have the potential of a little bit of a performance increase with Sainz that isn't a given but with the caveat of all the other stuff. And rn apart from Imola Perez hasn't been that bad that all of the extra stuff is worth it I guess",
