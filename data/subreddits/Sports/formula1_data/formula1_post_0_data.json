He started this streak with a P5 in the sprint shootout in China, and the race weekend where he had his 5th P5 finish in a row (Imola), he qualified P5 too. \n\nNow that\u2019s consistency.",

Sainz's management has been working for more momey. Why don't they run for Sainz? They value their cars not crashin eachother and probably think that many other Checo style midfielders will be willing to drive for them.\n\n\nFerrari: For them it was more about what Lewis represented and the staff that could be attracted by having him in the team.\n\n\nMcLaren: Has a clear leader in Lando and strong partner in Piastri.

He is arguably the best driver to not win a championship since 2010, and was a constant threat to Mercedes even in their dominant years. Some say him moving to Renault was a bad move, but I think 2020 was the best season of his career. He's not as bad as his McLaren stint, as he has high moments much regularly (Mexico, Brazil, Miami), and seems to be constantly improving since Japan.
