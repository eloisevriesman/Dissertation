The main body and arms seems to be knitted with maybe 4-5mm needles.\n\nThe yarn looks like a mohair, with how it\u2018s draping probably mixed with silk.\n\nIf it indeed was a custom design, like someone in the comments below said, then the whole making of this will probably have taken about 200h or more, depending on how fast it was knitted and how long the designing process took.\n\nThis is probably one of the very few luxury clothes cases where that price would be absolutely reasonable.\n\nedit: after looking at a better picture, I can say that at least the ribbing is definitely hand knit and that I feel terrribly sorry for the person who spent hours doing the Italian bind off on that",

I don't really like high fashion, but it's nice to see him using his platform to promote other people's art. On the other hand, I think it's a bit weird to have your work outfit being curated every week. I know he doesn't do it himself, but having some clothes chosen for you instead of just waking up and picking something from the closet just seems really weird to me.",
