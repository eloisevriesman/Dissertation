Ground effect works by trapping the air under the car and lowering the pressure as it travels towards the back. Lowering the pressure means the water is ripped up from the surface. Makes sense even for someone with even basic understanding of physics. \n\nBut still, as I said, it's worth trying. Even just so they have something ready if they ever decide to drop the ground effect car concept again.",

The wake of the plane isn\u2019t distributed that much in the vertical axis. A normal wing performs best with laminar flow, which inherently doesn\u2019t cause vertical airflow. Lift is a product of a difference in air pressure caused by a change in the relative speed of the air; it\u2019s not directly a product of displacing air.\u00a0\n\nIn the context of an F1 car, the wings don\u2019t create a lot of net vertical air flow.

You couldn't really do a HUD, drivers need visibility across the entire FOV, and a HMD (or even HUD) is a massive amount of sensors and weight and cost added to the car. And you'd also need to figure out how to get alignment right, most IR displays do not work at the distances that F1 cars care about, they end up heavily misaligned up close because the camera and the display aren't in the same place.",

I mean the F-35 has \"360 see-through\" mode that essentially allows the piolet to look through the plane in situations like look down targeting. But it cost like 400k just for the HUD not even including the computational costs and components that are needed to process these things. Which will not only have a cost penalty but also energy and weight. \n\nThere have been similar systems being prototyped for commercial flight operations with ar/huds that show things like glide slopes it's while landing but again space and weight aren't as big of a challenge. \n\nCars will need to have more cameras/lidar, processing, display/project systems in the helmets. I think it's too many points of failure. \n\nAlso while Google, Amazon and HP do alot of interesting things I wouldn't exactly trust them with safety critical stuff, Let alone the fact that they would need to justified business case for it's commercial usage before they even try to develop it. And if self driving tech in cars which does share some hardware/software requirements with this use case just without the decision making/driving part removed have anything to go by its just to slow and cumbersome for high speed/low productivity conditions like racing\n\nP.s.
