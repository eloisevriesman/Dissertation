It seems he\u2019s got another side where he will just go in mercilessly on the team when they\u2019re not doing well.",

What happens when Luka isn't on ball? What does he do? Does he screen for his teammates? Does he battle for post position? No, he mostly chills out. Tatum has fewer on-ball responsibilities (still plenty) but he's more active off-ball.\n\n>there's nothing that sticks out that points to \"better conditioning\" other than Luka being a bit chubby.\n\nLuka and the Mavs have openly acknowledged it as an issue at times.",
