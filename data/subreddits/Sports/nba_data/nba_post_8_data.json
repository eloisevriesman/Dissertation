The Celtics are fundamentally a worse team defensively without holiday on the floor. The drop off for the bucks from holiday to Lillard was massive.

Last year he was basically ignored despite maybe having his best season, and even got left off all defense. He got the one seed with Middleton missing much of the year. However because Embiid beat Jokic in a head to head and then took their next game off he got it. This year the team had a down year but he improves his scoring and efficiency. However now team record and seeding matters (we were still a top 3 seed) and Shai who scored, assisted, and rebounded less with a worse TS%  and got embarrassed in their head to head near the end of the season is unanimously ahead of him because he\u2019s the new toy. Giannis also misses out on any defensive honor once again. It\u2019s crazy imo and feels like the goalposts are moved so he can\u2019t win.
