Even if you are right and the Toronto WNBA team might be profitable from year one based on revenue - operatings costs = profit. It would still likely take years if not longer to recoup that 100m start up cost. Keep in mind last year the ENTIRE WNBA made in revenue somewhere around 200m. So even if the Toronto team is making a couple million per year in pure profit, it would take DECADES to pay off that start up cost and actually be in the black. \n\nNot trying to argue that \"Hurrrr Womens basketball isn't profitable they shouldn't do it!!!\" at all. Thats not how business works, especially in a still growing league like the WNBA. There's good business reasons and opportunity to owning a WNBA team, which is why Tanenbaum went off on his own to buy/own one. Long term it will be profitable and more importantly, the overall franchise valuation will only increase which is REALLY what a private ownership group like Tanenbaum and his team care about. \n\nJust pointing out that there are CLEAR business risks/costs involved with starting a new WNBA team, that clearly did not entice MLSE to take on.",

Nobody spends $10M on an apartment building and expects $10M+ in profit year one. Of course they likely won't recoup their $100M investment in year one. But in addition to profit, the value of the franchise itself will also be increasing. In short, they would almost certainly see a year on year capital gain in their asset, in addition to any operating profit.\n\nIt's worth noting that the WNBA currently gets $60M/year from its tv contract for American broadcast rights. The NHL gets around 10x that much, *even though ratings for the two are almost exactly the same*. You can obviously knock some value off that for the WNBA because there are fewer games (and thus less content), but the WNBA contract is up this year, so the Toronto team will be walking into a completely different revenue world.",
