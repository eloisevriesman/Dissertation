Without researching to confirm, my memory is Curry was one of those guys who are sensational in college but you don't know how their game will translate because they're so unique, so they fall in the draft.

The only knock on Steph's game wasn't actually his game and it was his ankles and him being seen as soft. That was the only reason you would ever choose Ellis over him. Ellis was the ultimate me-first player to the point of him coming up with his own quote of \"montae do it all.\" I think most Warrior fans were ready to cut Montae especially when you factor in him doing dumb shit and sexually harassing Warriors employees. It's fun to look back on the Warriors before the bandwagoners and Steve Kerr turning the team into a platform for the DNC. Kerr almost makes me yearn for the days of Marc Jackson segregating the locker room by race and religion(for some reason, people want to pretend it was only religion because it's socially acceptable to attack Christians and not race, too).",

Like it's larger than the gap between the Pistons and Celtics. The Fever are slow to rotate on D and stay home in their man way too often. They do not switch coverages, which leads to a lot of line drives to the basket. They do not reach in which allows the opposing team to back down easily and never throw doubles. On offense, they are very stagnant. There have been multiple times where Clark has the ball and gets trapped with her only outlet in the middle of the paint. A perimeter player should be rotating to the ball to give her an easier outlet and reset. Their screens are soft (think Richaun Holmes soft) and the only person worth hedging is Clark since everyone else seems to airball their 3s. They have a lot of work to do to give her the talent necessary to succeed.",

I do believe they have the personnel to be a competent team (Aliyah Boston and Caitlyn Clark is a good base) so a decent coach would be able to figure something out to get them at least into the playoffs.",

Either that or the defender will front Boston, so the only option is to throw it over the top, where there is a defender waiting on her backside because, as I said, their spacing is HORRIBLE. They are essentially playing 4 on 2 with 3 teammates standing around on the other side of the court, and unfortunately Clark is not tall enough to make an accurate cross-court pass to one of her 2 wide open teammates.",

There's a lot more sports in the world than people may realize, and the money isn't flowing in all of them. \n\nLacrosse, I would think has enough money to support you during in season at least. Nothing glamorous but a respectable salary. I mean, many of us work 40 or more hours a week to make less than 50k a year. \n\nI think being a sports professional entails spending much of your time practicing and playing your sport. If you work a 9-5 all year I don't see how you can possibly have the time to be a proffeaional at a sport. I think a more accurate term would be semi-pro or aspiring pro. I'm not trying to knock anyone just looking at this realistically.",

Taurasi is still around, right, the league still has players from the OG UConn Tennessee rivalry.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nE ven the question is a little misleading, though.\u00a0 If you're growing something you don't necessarily care if you're profitable.\u00a0 For example if you build an arena, it only becomes profitable after you make enough profit to offset that initial investment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0When people were saying Tesla lost $15,000 per car they don't mean it cost them $15k more to build it than it sold for.\u00a0 It's because they had to build the factory first, it's just accounting for total profitability.\u00a0 \u00a0 You also get tax breaks back for losing money.\u00a0 So it's them investing money in WNBA as a long term growth investment. It doesn't necessarily mean it's unviable it's not profitable.\u00a0 \u00a0When you're talking about the NBA developing a whole new brand and the associated contacts with the way TV is headed that's worth a shitload of money thinking of it from a financial standpoint.\u00a0 It's not often\u00a0you can grow a new sports league, even the fact it's growing is significant.\u00a0 \u00a0",

She leads all-time points by 424, a margin that would've taken the former leader Kelsey Plum down below 4th even when she graduated (would take now-2nd down below now-9th). In fact no margin this wide has been opened in the history of women's NCAA basketball, the only comparable stand-out athlete breaking the historical record is Patricia Hoskins who is the only person close to Clark in Points Per Game, who did open up a then 2.28 PPG gap between the former PPG recordholder a few years earlier while also breaking the total points record, and the only reason Hoskins didn't get to show us what she was made of on the professional stage is because the WNBA... didn't exist yet.\n\nLike, I'm not saying Clark won't be facing a ton of pressure, or that she definitely won't be broken down by that pressure. But I'm saying no one's ever entered the WNBA with as dominant a college career as hers. And although Hoskins still holds the single-season PPG record, Clark did break the 4-year record that Hoskins has been holding since 1989, largely because of her senior year season which was insanely impressive. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_women%27s_basketball_career_scoring_leaders",

Like go to the WNBA Reddit. You\u2019ll find tweets of confused WNBA players asking for someone to show someone being mean or anything  to CC. I heard Barkley say this live and my immediate reaction was thinking he really just sounded like he was using a lot of social media (most wnba discourse is worse than NBA). A lot of \u201cthey tryna kill CC LMAOOO\u201d viral posts and shit. I don\u2019t follow Jemele Hill on anything but I\u2019m sure she is fanning the flames and pushing a narrative. I am a fan of A\u2019Ja and she did an interview about a lottttt of things. She was directly asked about CC and race and popularity and she did say CC\u2019s race played a factor in her popularity (true imo) but also heavily credited her and it was nowhere near meant to be a shot at CC. A LOT of right wing pages led with \u201cA\u2019Ja Wilson says CC is only famous because she\u2019s white\u201d which is want even close to what someone would take out of the full quote.

Hill believes that race played the role, but she leaves out a lot of other context that would weaken her claim.\n\n\n1) Both players played in the 2010s, a time where women's sports were still hit or miss on viewership/marketability.\n\n\n2) Both Moore and Parker played for UConn and Tennessee, two powerhouses for NCAAW. Clark played for Iowa, which doesnt have a strong NCAAW history so the public embraced Iowa (and by extension Clark) as sort of an underdog (and the public loves an underdog).\n\n\n3) Both played before the rise of streaming and social media becoming a standard part of people's livelihoods. This allowed Clark to reach more people with her highlights and game.",

Would more eyes on the league improve the bottom line or not?  Does it matter if Clark is a #1 all-star from day zero in the league or not, if the rest is true? \n\nThe answer to the first 2 is obviously yes, and the final point is it doesn't matter if Clark would experience growing pains or not, she's a good thing for women's pro basketball.\n\nDT had every reason to talk up Caitlin entering the league. And DT stands to gain nothing by taking the wind out of Caitlin's sails by suggesting it may not be worth watching.  Especially before Caitlin even plays. \n\n\nBottom line, it's counter to DTs and the WNBAs interest to talk about Clark the way she did. It's shooting yourself in the foot, and it looks stupid after being so public about wanting more money in pro women's basketball.  \n\nI'm not saying cancel her or that she's a bad person.

It's obvious Clark has a following, why not tap into that to build the league?  Unless she's too stupid/jealous/proud or something.  Seems pretty foolish \ud83e\udd37",

Her comments were a nothingburger, she was being a realist, but they've been blown out of proportion and have caused a lot more people to talk about the WNBA now. If she had just given generic boilerplate positive comments about Clark, that creates absolutely zero engagement or interest. Taurasi is seen as the Kobe Bryant of the WNBA. She's a competitive killer and there's nothing better in sports than competitive fire, spirit, and rivalries. Now whenever they play each other, there'll be this narrative of a young generational Curry-esque talent going up against the old GOAT and people are going to be more interested to watch because of Taurasi's past comments. Stuff like that is great for leagues. Use your brain before you call people stupid.",

                            "body": "Diana Taurasi, Breanna Stewart, and others took offense to Clark being called a GOAT at the college level. There are 3 things you can look at with it: NIL, UConn, and the State of Iowa.\n\n**NIL**. Clark is the first big \"star\" of the College Women's Basketball of the NIL era in the sport so she is getting Nike deals, nationally ran State Farm ads, etc that Diana and Breanna didn't get when they were in school. Part of the reason Clark became front and center was Paige Bueckers got injured her second year and where does Paige go to school? UConn\n\n**UConn**. Diana Taurasi, Breanna Stewart, and a lot of others have 1 big thing in common. They went to UConn. UConn for College Women's Basketball has been the standard in the sport as a program for 40 years basically. Thanks in no small part for getting a winning coach in Geno smith early into the NCAA allowing Women's Basketball after Title IX and as a result has had many of the greatest players: Sue Bird, Rebecca Lobo, Maya Moore, and all the others I mentioned before. So with Clark who didn't go to UConn getting GOAT talk and NIL/Media Coverage ahead of Paige is not right to many of them. Speaking of Geno, one thing brought up by I believe Diana was that Geno wouldn't allow Clark to shoot those long shots so some might be jealous of that freedom she got to play her game. The other thing Breanna brought up was Clark can't be a GOAT without a National Title ignoring the fact that when Breanna(1st pick) her senior year had a team that had 2nd pick(2016), 3rd pick(2016), 4th pick(2017), 4th pick(2019) 6th pick(2019), 10th pick(2018), 26th pick/3rd round(2017). Meanwhile for Clark(1st pick) one of her best teammates is not even in WNBA and decided to stop playing will be attending the University of North Carolina to get her Masters in Occupational Therapy. We joke about the pass era being plumbers but Clark's teammates for the most part were that(no offense to them) comparatively to the National Title teams that Breanna had \n\nThe closets example I can think of is it is lot like the old Miami Hurricane football players seeing the state of the Miami football team now if college football only started in 1970. Which leads to another issue for UConn. The program is in the largest drought for a title: 7 years now(8 if you count Covid cancelled one) since Geno got to UConn. It took Geno 9 years to win a title and since then they have never gone more then 4 years with out a title. \n\n**State of Iowa**. I am biased as an Iowan, but in the State of Iowa you will probably not find a place that more supports women's/girl's basketball to the level that the state does and that helps push any player to being more known then players playing at any other college or from anywhere else as they have their hometown and home state support locked. Part of it dates back to the 1800s and being an early adopter of women's rights: second state in the nation to allow married women to own property(1846), first woman elected to public office(1869), first State owned public universities to allow women to get degrees(1857), etc. Which would lead to Iowa having High School girl's basketball state tournaments starting in 1920 and would lead to the point that [\"In 1970, 20 percent of all girls participating in high school sports across the country were in Iowa\u2014quite remarkable, considering Iowa was only 1 percent of the entire U.S. population. By 1976, a few years after the passage of Title IX, that eye-popping 20 percent fell to 5.8 percent.\"](https://www.neh.gov/article/when-iowa-girls-basketball-ruled-courts). Which is a maddening stat. For reference, my Grandma(born in 1930) was been playing High School basketball in Iowa at the same time as the early NBA guys like Bob Cousy(1928) and Bill Russell(1934) along with legendary coaches like Dean Smith(1931). While those who got started at the High School level under Title IX where the generation with Larry Bird(1956) and Magic Johnson(1959). While the youngest for the first WNBA season were with Tim Duncan(1976). \n\nThe High School Game was utterly loved here. 16,000+ would show up to Title game between two schools that maybe had a combined 1,000 people living in those towns and those tickets were sold waaay before the tournament started. It was broadcasted on TV(before the first NBA game ever was) and would air in Iowa and all the surrounding states and get 3.5 Million watching on TV. And with all that Clark is just a part of the long line of great basketball players out of Iowa:\n\n* Denise Long Rife(Whitten, Iowa). She was the first woman drafted by a National Basketball Association (NBA) team, although NBA Commissioner Walter Kennedy vetoed the pick on grounds that, at the time, the league did not draft players straight from high school\u2014nor women. She held the High School Record for most points scored in a career and is one of 7 girls in the country(1 of 2 Iowans) to score 100+ points in a game. 2 of the other 7 include Cheryl Miller and Lisa Leslie. Her record of 111 points in a single game held from 1968 to 2006. She was offered college scholarships but pre-Title IX women's college basketball was too limited to appeal to her.\n\n* Lynne Lorenzen(Ventura, Iowa/Iowa State). Broke Denise Long Rife's record for most points scored in a career and was the second player from Iowa to join the 100 point club in a game. She was also the first girl for the Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award(Dennis Scott was the first guy) recipient. Others guys and gals who have gotten the award include: Chris Webber, Shane Battier, Greg Oden, Lebron James, Ben Simmons, Diana Taurasi, Lisa Leslie, Candace Parker, Paige Bueckers. Also, got Iowa Miss Basketball\n\n* Molly Goodenbour(Waterloo, Iowa/Stanford). Won two titles at Stanford and was the Tournament MOP in 1992. Also, was Iowa Miss Basketball\n\n* Kiah Stokes(Cedar Rapids, Iowa/UConn). Has won titles everywhere: College, NBA, Europe. Was Iowa Miss Basketball\n\n* Lorri Bauman(Des Moines, Iowa/Drake). She was the first woman in NCAA history to score 3,000 points and at one time held the record for NCAA Division 1 women's basketball points scored in a career; the record has been successively broken by Patricia Hoskins, Jackie Stiles, Kelsey Plum, Brittney Griner, Kelsey Mitchell and most recently Caitlin Clark also surpassing Bauman's career total. For more than 25 years, she has held multiple NCAA scoring records, including (1) most field goals in a game, having made 27 of 33 field goal attempts (82%) in a January 6, 1984 game between Drake and Missouri State, (2) most free throws in a season, having made 275 of 325 attempts (84.6%) in 1982, and (3) most free throws in a career, having made 907 of 1,090 attempts from 1981 to 1984. She was also the first woman in NCAA history to score 3,000 points.[4] At the time of her graduation, Bauman was also the leading scorer in NCAA women's basketball history with 3,115 points in 1984. Her 1984 scoring total now ranks seventh on the all-time list.[5] Her total of 58 points against Missouri State in January 1984 was previously the NCAA single-game scoring record and is now tied for third on the all-time list. Her career average of 26 points per game ranks fifth on the all-time list. In 1982, Bauman scored 50 points against Maryland in the West Regional final, which remains the NCAA Tournament single-game scoring record (Maryland won that game, 89-78). She made 21 of 35 field goals and 8 of 11 free throws in the game. In January 2006, ESPN.com rated Bauman's 50-point game against Maryland as one of the top 25 moments of NCAA Tournament history.\n\n* Jan Jensen(Kimbolton, Iowa/Drake). Current and Newest Iowa Women's Basketball Coach. Jensen led Division I women's basketball in scoring her senior year, finishing with 29.6 ppg. In 2007, the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) named Jensen as one of the 35 greatest players in conference history, listing her on the MVC women's basketball All-Centennial Team as part of the conference's 100th anniversary.\n\n* Stacy Frese(Cedar Rapids/Iowa State). Had 2 games where she went 100% from beyond the 3 point line. Looking the NCAA minimum of 7 3 point shots for that 100% record it has only happened 59 times total.\n\n* Molly Bolin(Moravia, Iowa/Grand View). She went on to star at the first women's professional basketball league in the United States, the Women's Professional Basketball League (WBL). Bolin, who was the first player signed with a team in the WBL, became a pioneering figure in women's basketball as a formidable scoring threat. Among her accolades, Bolin holds the Women's Professional Basketball League record for the most points scored in a single game (55) and the highest single-season scoring average (32.8). Both records beat the WNBA records as well. \n\n* Ashley Joens(Cedar Rapids/Iowa State). Iowa Miss Basketball. She currently is 11th all time scoring(meaning with Clark and Bauman 3 of the Top 11 scorers in NCAA History are from Iowa and went to Iowa Schools). She was also only the 4th player from the Big 12 Conference to record 30+ points and 15+ rebounds in an NCAA tournament game. She won the Cheryl Miller Award for best Small Forward in Women's College Basketball 3 times.  \n\nNow why did Iowa and Iowa State as universities become awesome like UConn? Well before Title IX the state played 6v6 basketball rather then 5v5 and after the complete switch in 1993 it took awhile to get into the 5v5 game as many were bitter the switch was forced on us. But once we did oh boy. Iowa State University has been to the Final Four like at all yet hasn't been ranked outside the Top 5 for fan attendance for 20 out of the last 24 seasons. With that Iowa and Iowa State both have had better average attendance then the vast majority of the WNBA teams and would be Top 40 overall when compared to the Men's teams.",

At the time, the new rising start was a young Chris Evert.   Not only was she a huge talent, but she was attractive and wholesome.\n\nAlthough she didn't sign up with the new tour right away, Billie Jean told the other women not to harass her, that Chris Evert was going to be the next women superstar, and to support her, and eventually, Chris did join the fledgling tour.  \n\nOf course, most women's sports has Billie Jean to thank for pushing equality in women's sports.  Maybe without women's pro tennis, there is no WNBA.  The big difference is men will watch women's tennis, but not so much the WNBA, but that might change, and this is that window of opportunity.\n\nChuck also had to thank Michael Jordan (and his mom) for getting him a huge shoe deal because it meant everyone else could get a huge shoe deal.  That impact was maybe bigger to all players today than his actual basketball accomplishments (without which, that shoe deal wouldn't have gone stratospheric).",

I said it is an Asian country, that doesn't mean it can't also be European. A country can fit in multiple regional and cultural spheres. However there's no denying that *currently* it's embracing its Asian side far more than its European side. Peter and Catherine have been dead a long time, buddy. \n\nAs for the rest of your stupidity, Israel certainly has tons of influence from Europe due to European Jews going back to their homeland, most of whom had been gone for centuries so yes they did bring European culture back with them. Australia was colonized by Europe and has very close ties to the UK and the rest of the Commonwealth. You are a person not a country, so that's an even stupider comparison to make. But if your black friends accept you into their families and culture what does it matter what your skin color is? It's a moot point anyway because Russia has ENORMOUS ethnic Asian populations: Kazakhs, Georgians, Mongols, Chinese, Koreans, etc. you name it. \n\nIgnorant Eurotrash really thought he had something thinking he was talking to a redneck Murican LMFAO.",

It's all fans and media doing that.\n\nThe narrative that WNBA players are jealous of her is way overblown, too. It's just a few vocal individuals who can get over it. Like you said, she hasn't won anything yet (not even a game), so they have nothing to be jealous of. If anything, the amount of media pressure put on Clark is a problem for her and not a help.",

The harsh reality is that the WNBA never makes a profit because no one watches it because there are multiple other basketball leagues where the players are all much better than any WNBA player. Caitlin Clark brought tons of eyes to women's basketball.

You grinding all day to hone your draft and I'm shit posting on Reddit. A 2-way NBA player in one season can make the same as the entirety of the top rookie contracts. A late 1st round pick in the NBA can make in one year what a HOF player could make in a lifetime. Shit is far from apples to apples. Shit is apples to jackfruit. \n\nIf thanks to CC you are now flying a chartered plan OR at least sitting in 1st class...**you're welcome**. Doesn't matter if it's coming from Chuck or Candace Parker, the message is clear: don't be petty like a man as even the pettiest man in the NBA is building generational wealth. instead, hop on her bandwagon so you too may sniff that CC endorsement money or maybe get a show deal worth a few millions or shit, get a yearly salary  that's in the hundreds of thousands. \n\nAgain, the top salaries in the WNBA is 250k/yr. The top pick in the WNBA is on a 4/340k salary. They NEED the attention a CC can give and they instantly need to get her some rivals as well. Ain't nobody talking about Jackie Young or Jewell Loyd like that. They ain't bringing change. CC is, already!\n\nChuck was 100% right and fuck it if it doesn't help CC today as it should help everyone tomorrow if they get their minds right...in the same way that the NBA hit everyone over the head w/Magic/Larry/Michael  to the point where all three are living legends today and helped usher in billion dollar TV deals w/the players hearing HUNDREDS of millions of dollars",

Just folks firing from the hip at something they refuse to look at. \n\nAs soon as he brings up \"getting you private charters\" it becomes obvious he has no idea what he's talking about.

(Indiana gets a charter to connecticut but connecticut doesn't get a charter to Indiana, stuff like that).\n\nIf this is the coverage the wnba gets from mainstream talking heads, it's probably best for everyone actually following the league to ignore it.

That\u2019s not to downplay or discount the hate any of those people have received. But it\u2019s helpful to contextualize the hate and to ultimately say confidently that the hate loses to the love.\n\nI could elaborate on some of your minor points but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important in the larger context of your point.",

They used their first names in the commercial. Sue Bird was the only one of the three I recognized.\n\n-I knew that Diana Taurasi was in Space Jam 2\n\n-Breanna Stewart got a lot of play leading up to the end of her college career, but then dropped out of national news. Ironically, Uconn WCBB might have a bigger media profile than the WNBA.\n\nIMO, the difference between CC and other stars is just that CC more entertaining to watch.

In the NBA no matter the race, this is true.\n\nThe same has happened inthe WNBA. A lot of people may not recognize them in the street, but they at least have passing familiarity with the big names like Lisa Leslie, Candace Parker, Nancy Lieberman, Diana Taurassi, Sabrina Ionescu, Sue Bird, etc.\n\nFurthermore, it's simply style of play that attracts or pushes away. Tim Duncan, KG, Jokic, Yao, Ewing, Malone, Olajuwon, Mourning, Robinson, Mutombo, all NBA greats that don't sell shoes that well and arguably don't put seats in butts nearly as much as someone like Vince Carter, who is a great player, but can't hold a candle to the accomplishments/isn't as good at bball as the likes of TD, KG, Jokic, Yao, Malone, Ewing, Olajuwon, Robinson.\n\nShaq is an marketing anomaly among big men becaues of his personality.\n\nLuka and Jokic are the two of the top 5 or 6 right now, but they aren't really that that marketable.\n\nRacism and discrimination are real and not deniable things that are very important to put down. At the same time, we've also got to give some credit to people that maybe they just like someone because they can personally relate to them a little bit more, and a lot of times people simply do relate to someone they have some level of common ethnicity with, and that's just human nature. There are differences in background that make people feel affinity towards one or another more naturally. Asian people went more wild for Jeremy Lin than other races. Balkan people are going to love Luka and Jokic more than the average white American. The average white person in the USA is going to feel they relate to Clark more than Jokic or Doncic or other races, because she is from the midwest and I believe grew up in suburbia. So even though I don't think she really grew up on a farm, that rural image you associate with her along with the nitty gritty image of the midwest and she is a suburban girl ( I think), that's just a combo for a very marketable image. Michael Jordan was a total southern kid (listen to his early interviews you can hear it in his voice) that grew up watching nascar races, playing baseball and basketball. He wore suits to games that made him look like your average corporate guy going to the office everyday. That relates.\n\nI think if Angel Reese had the same skill set as Clark, she would have a monster marketing image too. She leans into tension, and that's part of her appeal, and it's really admirable at times too. But if she had the same skill set as Clark (b/c those skills dazzle more than her big player on the block style) and gave PR ready answers, she would be just as marketable as Clark. In her interviews she is absolutely an angel of a sweetheart girl next door personality. It's actually pretty magnetic. The broader audence absolutely loves a sweet girl next door persona/image. I think she would be a media darling.\n\nOne interesting thing is that Angel actually has 1 million more instagram followers than Clark. Clark brings in more viewers to a game, but Angel has a certain appeal that Clark's personality set isn't able to touch. Clark is really cool to watch, Angel has a charisma to really empower something in a person's spirit that Clark doesnt' necessarily have in her charisma.",

Caitlin Clark deserves all of her success. I'm saying race plays a role in marketability because people naturally gravitate towards other people who look like them. That's why I used Jeremy Lin as an example. I live in New York and none of my Asian-American friends even watched basketball but still tuned in to see him. I understand why and I'm sure you do too. It's not even any different than my mom tuning in to watch Sue Bird because she sees himself in her. I'm sure it's the same with a lot of young kids who look up to Caitlin today. Even during social experiments conducted for research, people tend to group with others who they find to be similar to them, and there's nothing wrong with that.",

Clark's accomplishments thus far don't warrant the comparison to Bolt's. Also, you have to stop using the \"having minority superstars = no racial bias\" argument. That's like saying you're not racist because you have a black husband. Both can simulteanously exist, and I feel like you agree with me on that too but don't wanna say it.",

What we do know is that the previous holders of the college scoring records - Dyasha Fair and Kelsey Plum were nowhere near as popular.\n\nAlso, I thought Breanna Stewart was popular though? In my first comment to you, I mentioned that Stewart, Bird, and Ionescu were the only players I knew before watching the WNBA so I assumed she was.\n\nEither way, I'm done posting here since we can't seem to agree on this. Obviously, I believe Caitlin Clark's popularity is mainly due to her skills and playstyle. But if you do believe that racial bias exists in sports, then you can't pick and choose who to apply that too. Like you said, it applies to Luka and Jokic. But why aren't you willing to admit it applies to Caitlin too? You can't simply say \"oh she's so great, she transcends race\", but still consider racial bias as a detriment for other white players in the NBA.",

For example Angel Reese has 3.2 million IG followers and she was the 7th overall pick, compared to Breanna Stewart a 2 Time MVP and one of the most accomplished players of all time being 360K.\n\nThe reason a player like Reese was so popular was because she was one of the best players, on a big team, during a big spike in her sports popularity.\n\nSo now you are talking about the GOAT of NCAA women\u2019s basketball, at the peak of NCAA women\u2019s popularity, playing a style of play we have never seen a women play before and only recently seen men play this way (and even then it\u2019s a rare group of NBA superstars). \n\nBy attributing her success/popularity to her race, you are taking away from her accomplishments as a player. Especially when we have seen countless examples of sports superstars be minorities, showing that fans want to watch greatness, and they aren\u2019t fixated on race (like you appear to be). \n\nTake care",

At this point, women just can\u2019t do that. A handful can dunk, but I\u2019m not sure if any of them can really even dunk *on* someone, maybe Griner?\n\nThat version of basketball simply wasn\u2019t (and still isn\u2019t) reproducible in women\u2019s basketball. At best, you\u2019ve pretty much got a bunch of Tim Duncan\u2019s. And I\u2019d take Duncan over Kobe, but people weren\u2019t lining up to watch Duncan and fundamental basketball. \n\nBut now that what draws views/excitement is crazy, deep, pull-up shots and electric passes, women *can* do that.

You kind of hit it in your own comment, where you talk about VC/Iverson being \u201ccool\u201d and Dirk implicitly not-cool. I bet kids in Germany were imitating Dirk all of the time. So what makes Dirk not-cool to you and cool to the Germans? There\u2019s a cultural connection there that makes Dirk relatable to the German people that doesn\u2019t translate to people living in the USA.\n\nIt\u2019s similar on a racial level as well. White and Black culture is not the same. What resonates with the Black community won\u2019t necessarily resonate with the white community and vice versa. Obviously it\u2019s all more complex than that, totally possible for athletes of any race to have universal appeal (eg MJ), but that\u2019s the gist. It\u2019s why celebrities tend to be more popular in the racial demographics that they come from. \n\nWhat bothers me is when people apply this logic unevenly.

Coaches would impress on me to work on the type of shot Duncan could make but I also realistically didn\u2019t emulate his game much. The guys I wanted to watch just had an entertaining style of play, same as Clark \n\nI guess someone like Jason Williams whose play style was more aesthetically entertaining but I also wouldn\u2019t say I cared about him much just because there were guys who played similarly but were just way better (and happened to be black most of the time). I\u2019m sure a lot of kids now are doing ridiculous finger roll threes because of Luka, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s got much to do with him being white, it\u2019s just fun to watch\n\nIn the case of Dirk/german kids, I could see that strictly because these kids might have only gained any interest in basketball at all because a \u201clocal\u201d guy is suddenly massively famous in America, and maybe he\u2019s the only reason you\u2019re watching in the first place. But I think you could say the same about white kids in Greece because of giannis",

Well what is or isn\u2019t considered \u201centertaining\u201d is actually a cultural construct, and will vary from culture to culture. Maybe in Germany people value fundamentals over flashy moves, so Dirk is actually a more \u201centertaining\u201d player.\n\nLike this kind of stuff isn\u2019t the end all be all, but it adds up to make it easier for people to be more well liked by their own racial demographic.",

Even though Clark is a white woman entering a field where she's a minority, she still lives in a country where white women are the majority and have more purchasing power than black women.

If basketball fans were racists then why isnt Jokic the face of the nba?\n\nIt's just natural that there is going to be backlash and some hate for CC.  Bird and Magic actually DID go through the same thing as did MJ.  Plenty of players hated MJ out of jealousy.  I also think in my experience that women are just as prone if not more so to jealousy of other women than men are despite what Chuck says. \n\nPro athletes will think of any small reason to hate on an opponent and psych them up.

In a league that was dominated by a bevy of black athletes who were brash, cocky, athletic, yet plagued by drug abuse white viewers were losing their interest. And much like how Magic was maligned by the media for his personality on the court and flashy play, Angel Reese is similarly looked at as being too cocky and needing humbling.\n\nCaitlin comes into the WNBA as a straight white woman who just had the most electrifying seasons in woman\u2019s college hoops. And yes being straight matters here. Put it quite plainly, there are hundreds of thousands of men who simply want to fuck Caitlin Clark. Or at least feel like they have a chance (they don\u2019t). Before her, most of the WNBA\u2019s legends are gay, black, or both.\n\nCC is a tremendous talent. Incredible work ethic and will more than likely be a key contributor on multiple title contenders. She\u2019s also easily marketable due to her being the straight white girl next door a lot of white men do find attractive. Both are true. Neither take away from each other. She\u2019s not to blame. There is no blame.\n\nThe issue is how dismissive everyone else is of the W. That she is \u201csaving\u201d the league. She\u2019s not. The W was growing before her. It\u2019s growing with her. It will grow after her. Yes her story will be told for generations, but so should Diana Taurasi, Sue Bird, Candace Parker, Sheryl Swoops, etc etc",

I honestly don't recall any negative comments from actual players. It's nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nHowever, certain segments of media and social media have completely lost their minds over this girl. Idk if it's backlash against the new fans she brought in, the fact the breakout star is white and straight in a league where neither of those are the demographic of its previous great stars, or just general jealousy.

I know the sizes are way different, but the NFL has shown us that the schedule is not random.  You can get a little WWE with the schedule making.  Now is arguably the most important period in the history of the WNBA, and the league knows this when they made the schedule.  So maybe schedule the Fever to play the other really bad teams to start the season so you can get highlights of Clark going off and then have the Fever play the tougher teams later on.  The WNBA has complete control over the schedule and could have absolutely planned for this.  I don\u2019t think this is a ludicrous take",

Then you add on top of it the way WNBA training camp starts TWO WEEKS after the NCAA championship game. It's not exactly a level playing field. Which didn't only negatively effect CC, as Kamilla Cordozo was also playing till the last game, and had an injury in the preseason.\n\nCould you imagine how much worse the NCAAF occurrences of players sitting out of bowl games would be if they knew the draft was a week after the bowl game, and their NFL  preseason started two weeks later??!?!\n\nI don't think any rational person thinks it's rigged or anyone is out to get anyone.

Apart from the classic box score trolls who are just trolling for attention (who exist in every sport ever), the overwhelming majority of comments around Clark from WNBA players are positive. The one quote in otherwise long positive soundbyte that people harp on (Taurasi) was overblown, as all she said there\u2019s a transition period. Was it put very bluntly and somewhat abrasive? Sure, but I would say it came more from a place from personal experience than pettiness. Players absolutely recognize her talent and how big of a paradigm shift she is for the league. At the same time, they aren\u2019t going to lessen their play just so Clark can get her stats off, and I\u2019m sure it would be a disservice to Clark to do so. \n\nThe main issue with the fan base. Whether they are Iowa homers very protective of their prodigal daughter, new fans of womens ball who found the star player to latch onto who cannot do any wrong in their eyes, or the darker/more toxic side of the fan base (who have thinly veiled racism or homophobia in their comments). They seem to view any criticism as hating, and any fault of hers as someone else\u2019s. And when people push back on the fan base, the media views it as \u201clook at all these people being petty.\u201d",

I\u2019m not going to win an argument with you on that. You can point to Elvis and even more mobile QBs in the NFL. \n\nHowever, I just don\u2019t think that analogy works for the WNBA. Are there racists out there that root for CC for racist reasons and use dog whistles to criticize other WNBA players? Absolutely, it would be disingenuous for me to suggest that is not the case. I do not think that applies for Caitlin Clark. This was the top rated recruit and broke NCAA scoring records. She was pulling up from 30 and dropping dimes. She was incredibly entertaining and was a sure fire top pick. \n\nCaitlin Clark was must see TV. We hadn\u2019t seen a women\u2019s college player that way, similar to how we hadn\u2019t see a high school player like Lebron. \n\nThe WNBA is an entertainment product. No matter how much work prior players were doing, it was not bringing in viewership or honest engagement. Caitlin Clark is. For the WNBA to take the next step, they need to ensure Caitlin Clark has backing. Throwing shade at Caitlin does nothing to advance the WNBA. People want to see Caitlin, they don\u2019t want to see BG playing in the post.",

We've seen phenomenally talented players come through college to the WNBA like Breanna Stewart, Maya Moore, Candace Parker, Sue Bird, Brittney Griner, etc, and no one's been close to Clark's level of fame.\n\nYou also look at someone like Jacy Sheldon, who's white and went 5th overall in this past year's draft, but is far less famous than Clark, and much less well known than the 2-3 players who were picked after her too (Aaliyah Edwards, Angel Reese, Alissa Pili).\n\nSo I don't want to downplay the impact race can and does have, but I think it's pretty clear that Caitlin Clark is something much different than what the WNBA's had before",

It's also natural for pros to be pissed that a \"savior\" is entering the league. Remember when dogshit lottery Cavs were interviewed about potentially drafting Lebron?

You can get resentful at the eyes, but that does not help the eyes. CC getting the league from being subsidized by the NBA to financially independent would honestly be one of the most impressive sports/biz feat of the 21st century imo.\n\nCC is not going to be all things to all people, she wants to play basketball, not take down the patriarchy lol.

In the end the Bird-Magic era elevated the NBA in a massive way.  And now the NBA is so huge it's honestly past those issues. The best player the last few years has happened to be white, but he's still not the most popular player out there. maybe not even top 5 in terms of fandom.\n\nI can totally see being a grinding, underpaid athlete for years and getting pissy about some goofball coming in out of nowhere to \"save\" the sport. but it would be nice if there wasn't a microphone (or social media post) to cover every moment of natural human pettiness.

The WNBA has been growing, was on a path to get chartered planes, and there are some other exciting players that are popular, but Clark has accelerated the speed in which everything is happening. She has been causing an increase in ticket sales everywhere which causes them to even move to a bigger arena so that's just one of the many tangible things that they can point at as the growth.
