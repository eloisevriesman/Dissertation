Those alone are enough for Giddey's side to say \"ok, what do we need to do to keep this underage relationship quiet and avoid pulling Giddey away from NBA games to sit in a courtroom?\"... but presumably if there was a relationship, there would be other photos, texts, etc that gave the family a significant amount of leverage.\n\nThere were rumors the family was rich and didn't care what their 16 year old did.  There were rumors she was using a fake ID.  That's all find and dandy, but still in a scenario like this where the gift horse of a potential settlement is in play, you kinda just have to go through the motions.   If we're taking it at face value that they hired Gloria Allred and refused to cooperate with police, that screams \"quiet settlement\".",

Short version is, a family befriended Jackson (mom, step-dad, boy).  The boy's biological father had been trying to get MJ to pay for various things and at some point MJ cut him off.  So what does he do?... go to the police?  No... he hires a civil litigator, asking Jackson for 20 million claiming his son was abused and threatening to go to police if he didn't pay up.   There is actually an audio recording where the biological father tells the step-dad his master plan to get money from Jackson.  Ask yourself, if you suspected your kid was molested, why would your first move be to ask for money?\n\nThe family eventually hired **Gloria Allred** and Larry Feldman to negotiate the settlement, which also allowed Jackson to avoid being dragged into trial.  His side thought it was a good move at the time to just make it all go away, but  it forever tarnished his reputation.\n\nSimilar in 2005.  The new family had known Jackson for years and were featured in the documentary where the boy was shown holding Jackon's hand and MJ admitting he would let kids sleep in his bed.  There had been a brief investigation, but nothing came of it.  Then Jackson cut the family off and they alleged that the molestation started AFTER the documentary.  As if the entire world was looking at MJ's relationship with kids under a magnifying glass, and this specific kid in particular, and that was when MJ decided, \"You know what?  Now would be a good time to finally start molesting this kid.\"   SO what was their first move... to go to police?  No, they tried hiring Larry Feldman, the same lawyer who negotiated the settlement for the 1993 case.\n\nDifference here was that California law had changed since 1993 and you could no longer have a civil trial before a criminal trial.  Also, Jackson was insistent he was innocent and refused to have another settlement further tarnish his reputation.  This mean that if the family was going to get any payout, they had to go through with the criminal trial first.  Had they won, it would have made the civil trial a breeze and they would have cashed out.  HOwever, if you look at the details of that trial, it was a total circus and clear the mother was mentally ill and had tried extorting money from other celebrities in the past.  Jackson won the case.\n\nThis isn't to say Jackson was definitely innocent and I'm aware other people eventually showed up wanting millions, but the point is that the default is often to go for money.\n\nIn this Giddey incident, it was reported the 16 year old's family hired **Gloria Allred**.  It was reported they didn't cooperate with police.  There's no criminal trial to be had if they don't cooperate.  A nice settlement avoids all courtroom embarrassment.",

So now Giddey is expected to be able to identify fake IDs better than the club? Maybe I\u2019m missing details but that part of the response to the allegations always baffled me",

So we have this obsession with sexual misconduct.  Which, of course there actually ARE really horrible sexual crimes that SHOULD be punished. But the conflation of actual sexual harassment/assault/rape with statutory rape between two consenting parties is a pretty bad side effect of our culture, especially in the cases of like, a high school boyfriend and girlfriend being on either side of the age of consent. \n\nOr the idea that Giddy would have to wear the \u201cpedophile\u201d label when we have 0 reason to think he is a pedophile? Having sex with a 17 year old should not make you a fucking pedophile.",

That was at least 1-2 years prior according to the claims of the account that posted them.\n\nAlso, there is nothing that has proven they met at a club. People state that as a known fact when that\u2019s literally just been speculation because there was a video of them talking about going to a club, which he likely got in with whoever he was with with no check because he\u2019s a professional athlete.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he needed to ask for her ID, but the idea that he didn\u2019t realize in the multiple times they hung out that she was underage is such a stretch to imagine. Picking her up at her parents? She can\u2019t legally drive? In the potentially weeks or months that he knew her he never asked how old she was even just out of curiosity? Never met her friends?\n\nIt\u2019s not about Puritanism. Not even close. It\u2019s about people making excuses to explain away things that point more to him likely being creepy than him being innocent.\n\nThe only people I see making takes like this are ones who are simply getting details wrong about what we do and don\u2019t know.",

Were all of us perfect at 19? I\u2019ve personally seen countless 17 year olds easily sneak in/get into a club with fake ids, who they know, money, etc. Not saying that is what happened but all of the people crucifying Giddey wont even stop to consider that COULD have happened. He automatically is guilty to them regardless of what law enforcement says. Frankly I think that comes from a deep rooted envy on Reddit , that all the rich and famous must somehow be evil slime. We are losing empathy as a society and it\u2019s saddening to watch.",

It literally *does not affect your life* whether or not Josh Giddey fucked a 17 year old. So why are you so eager to rush to judgement on the situation based on nothing more than tabloids? Like do you just have an innate urge to gossip and moralize about more successful people than you? I\u2019m honestly confused by that impulse as well as your impulse to defend the mentality of a mob.",

They both claim they hooked up at his friends house and then she left because she was tired from drinking. Later on she asked them to come over and Rose declined at first since it was late and she persisted so he and his two friends came. I believe she asked that the two others come along iirc\n\nShe claimed they all came in and one at a time had sex with her but that she was too drunk to consent. They claimed they did all have sex with her but she was consenting and used the evidence of texts she sent earlier to indicate why they were coming over. This is where the \"we men you can assume\" thing came from because a lawyer asked Rose why do you think she called for three men to imminently come to her house at 3am and that was his answer\n\nHer lawyers also hid evidence of incriminating texts from her from Rose's defense team and they couldn't find another witness to corroborate her claims. Her roommate testified that she was a habitual liar and had told her of the sexual encounter multiple times including that next morning and never indicated any kind of assault had taken place\n\nRose's lawyers also got her to admit she lied about money repeatedly including making Rose that night give her $200 for a cab when she said it cost like $30 and made him reimburse her for a sex toy she claimed she bought when she was given it for free\n\nThere were also multiple texts from her to a friend saying she needs to go find an expensive man because she's broke and texts in the aftermath saying how she was going to get plastic surgery and a big TV once she sues Rose for the money\n\nThe real nail in the coffin was her whole testimony relied on her being too drunk to consent yet the texts she sent had perfect grammar and punctuation, like even more so than her \"sober\" texts\n\nAs far as him not understanding consent, he testified that he didn't know what the actual word \"consent\" meant, not that he didn't understand the concept of it",

And u need to come to me right now\n> \n> Rose: What's the address\n> \n> Doe: (Address)\n> \n> Rose: I'm finna have my guy come pick you up\n> \n> Doe: Come with him babe\n> \n> Rose: He bringing u back here and we gon make sure u get to work\n> \n> Doe: I need u to come with him\n> \n> Rose: Why u coming back to me\n> \n> Doe: So I want you here too\n> \n> Rose: He bringing u back here\n> \n> Doe: I know he will, I want u here too\n> \n> Rose: He already on his way\n> \n> Doe: aight he turned around to pick u up\n\nShe then the next morning only texted Rose about money for the sex toy and cab ride\n\nShe admitted under testimony she only sued Rose because he stopped responding to her texts and only would respond when she brought up money issues\n\nShe admitted to lying 6 times between her deposition and texts to Rose that night during her testimony\n\nHer defense team purposely hid texts where she asked for Rose to get her ecstacy and when she sent the nude that morning\n\nShe claimed she was drugged by Rose and his friends at the party even though her friend she was with explicitly denies this\n\nAgain, it's all a he said she said but she was caught lying multiple times and had texts before to her friend she needed a wealthy man and was going to go find one soon\n\nIt's a messy situation but it seems the most likely outcome was she was a FWB with Rose for close to 2 years, got mad when he stopped talking to her, and decided to sue him for \"rape\" as a way to get money out of him",

She might have seen that relationship as totally consensual.\n\nStill, it's illegal for a 20 year old to bang a 16 year old and by definition of the law, not consensual.  It got out publicly.  It's embarrassing.  And even if the family was apathetic to it, money is money and the gift horse of taking a big fat cash settlement to keep mum about their underage daughter's statutory rape probably was hard to pass up... hence hiring Glorida Allred and refusing to cooperate with police.  When life gives you lemons... hire the biggest civil litigation attorney there is, put pressure on the dumb multi-millionaire that you'll file criminal charges and drag him out of the playoffs into a courtroom, and set your kid up for a lifetime financial security.\n\nRealistically, how much is that settlement worth for Giddey to maintain some semblance of public innocence and have the opportunity for major endorsement deals?  He already had a 40 million dollar sponsorship deal he was very much at risk of losing.  The family had way too much leverage to just say \"hey no big deal... we just hired Glorida Allred for funsies\"",

Did Giddey have an obligation to find the truth and run a bg check? No. \n\nSo, no charges. This is how the system should work. Burden of proof should be high for being labeled a predator or offender.",
