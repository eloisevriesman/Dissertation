Luka would attack on the PNR and muscle McDaniels \u201cjailing\u201d him behind him, while Kyrie would blow by Edwards or Conley. Both situations would leave a trailing defender, a big rolling hard to the rim, and Gobert stuck in no man\u2019s land. \n\nThe primary defenders were \u201cup\u201d on them but they were up at the 3 point line and Kyrie / Luka are too good ball handlers to get behind the 8 ball like that. If Gobert was expected to be there with the primary defenders there needed to be better rotations behind him - there was not. \n\nThis is why the announcers (and anyone watching the game) naturally assumed the goal was to take away the Mavs 3 point shooting. The guys that would have to rotate were sticking close to the corners.",

Derek Lively played 26 minutes and got 11 boards.  \n\nThe drop coverage actually worked on average because the Mavs didn\u2019t get a bunch of 3s out of the short roll and settled for long twos.  That\u2019s partially why the 3 point percentage was so low - they took less open ones.  \n\nIf they blitz they will die from the 3pt line. It\u2019s not like Luka or Kyrie aren\u2019t great passers and the Mavs screeners are athletic and long with massive catch radiuses.  \n\nLuka and Kyrie will always be a mismatch\u2014 I bet the wolves need at least 110 to win any of the games going forward (which is doable - Ant and KAT will have better shooting nights).\n\nAt the end of games maybe you want the ball out of Luka\u2019s hands, but he\u2019s generationally patient.  If he and Kyrie hit every shot down the stretch you\u2019re going to lose anyways.",
