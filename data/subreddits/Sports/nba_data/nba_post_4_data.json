It was a transparent move to maneuver so they could win exactly ONE playoff series so they could sell that to the fans / ownership / Donovan Mitchell as \"progress\".\n\nNow they can fire JB too, even tho it's obvious to everyone the issue with the team is all the overlap / anti-synergy of the roster construction.",

There is generally just as much of a chance of getting a worse coach as a better coach. Especially when so often coaches are fired because the team thinks the players aren\u2019t responding to the coach any more. If your players are tired of listening to Rick Carlisle, maybe he has to go. But the odds are you end up with an inferior coach.\n\nAnd you also point out the counterpoint to firing coaches. People turning against Finch. That is part of the farce of coach blaming. Fortunately he was given time to develop the team. So I find myself unable to respect all the \u201cthat coach sucks\u201d comments sports fans love to make.\n\nFans might fixate on a team being subpar at X under one coach. They change coaches and now the team is better at X but subpar at Y and Z. Every strategy will have a compromise. In the end, only one team will win it all, no matter how good the losing coaches are. There just aren\u2019t enough championships to give to everyone. But many fans fixate on some team weakness and demand the weakness get fixed without creating different weaknesses. You can\u2019t optimize for every variable.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t have an opinion on Jason Kidd as a coach, but fans generally haven\u2019t respected him as a coach. Yet organizations seemed convinced as he quickly found jobs after getting fired. And it is impressive seeing a team with Kyrie and Doncic somehow play good defense.",

Derrick White is 6'4.5\" with a 6'7.5\" wingspan.  Jrue Holiday is 6'4.25\" with a 6'7\" wingspan.  (All measurements from tankathon.com's prospect comparison tool, which I believe uses NBA combine data.)  There's no effective difference in what Mitchell should be able to do versus what White and Holiday can do, at least in terms of size/reach. \n\nI would also say that in particular, the Cavs' guard size is not the reason they lost to the Knicks in 2023 or the Celtics in 2024, unless you make a case that Cleveland needed more defensive rebounds. \n\nMobley and Allen can pass.  Between them they averaged 5.9 assists to just 3.4 turnovers per game.  And that's mostly without running much offense through them, although Allen did get some significant work as a facilitator from the high post in December and January.  They're both good at catching the ball and passing it in traffic to each other. \n\nThe biggest issue is honestly that there are four really good offensive weapons but in order to maximize any of them individually they need the ball in their hands either as the point of attack or first pass.  I mean, Allen and Mobley are great finishers, but neither is maximized as \"just\" a finisher.  But Garland and Mitchell want the ball too, with both of them being more talented drivers and pull-up shooters than catch-and-shoot guys or cutters. \n\nMobley could average 20+ a game if possessions revolved around him.  Allen probably could too.  But Garland and Mitchell need to get their touches.  And so does Strus, a higher-volume player than Okoro was at the starting 3.  Niang's a higher-volume guy than Lamar Stevens whom he replaced. \n\nThe team desperately needs more Dean Wades, guys who'll be high energy and score 3 points on two shots in 20 minutes while setting screens, boxing out, and playing good defense.  And they honestly need that guy with the starters.  There's a reason he led the team in plus-minus: he doesn't need the ball to affect the game.",

No, but in a possible trade he's as fine a player to get back in return as you could hope (especially for LeBron, if he wants out). Darius Garland has more upside than DLo, and has better production, cmon man lol. It sounds like you're just defending DLo.\n\nHe was an All-Star, and was in many prediction lists to be picked that year as a reserve. If you want to critique that selection, that's fine, but it still speaks to his upside even if you debate it.\n\nHis contract is probably a slight overpay now, but it's going to look fine in the near future.

Everyone knows the massive albatross a max contract can have on teams if the player isn't a top tier player, and people should remember how Golden State was able to get Kevin Durant specifically because Curry was on a cheap deal + the salary cap increase, giving them significantly more talent than other teams.\n\nJarrett Allen probably has one of the 10 best non-Max contracts in the league for what he does.  The minor inconvenience of him + Mobley (and that's assuming Mobley doesn't continue to develop his outside shot, which he has to be at least respectable from 3) doesn't change that you are maximizing the dollars you get out of your players by having him on such a good deal, for 2 more years at that, especially since Mobley is still on a rookie contract.  I wouldn't be opposed a year down the line trading Allen when he has a year left and Mobley's max kicks in, but for right now, I don't think there's a deal where what you get back will come close to what you give up.\n\nAlso, as a secondary thing, the Cavs have been constantly beset by bad injuries.  This year had Mitchell, Garland, and Mobley all missing around 30 games, with Allen being the only one to play most of the year.  Having redundancies, especially with how easily players get injured nowadays, is not the worst thing in the world to have.",

Most of them were begging for this  \n  \nI think over time you'd realize the majority of the people in our sub that were *'begging for this'* are like the same 20-30 people over and over again as loudly as possible. A lot of them are even known by nicknames in the game threads.  \n  \nAsk them who they'd like to hire to replace JB and they'll either say \"anybody else is better\" or blindly \"JJ\" cuz they see him on TV.  \n  \nThe majority of the sub seem to think:  \n- Yes this is as far as JB and his system can take this team... it was time to part ways. Best for both parties.  \n- Moving on from JB is a huge piece of re-signing Mitchell so it has to be done  \n- ... But there really aren't a ton of homerun hires out there right now",

Not that easy. Two guards who didn't compliment eachother and whose defensive credentials have been pretty poor, and who don't seem to want to play with eachother. The team overachieved in the regular season, because of Bickerstaff. When you look around the league and at other successful teams this Cavs roster has been backwards his whole time there and, in the regular season at least, he turned it into an advantage - because playoff teams were able to adjust to the backwardness that now becomes Bickerstaff can't coach when he was clearly making the most out of a pretty weird collection of ingredients.",

Locker room culture was great and they played with effort. \n\nIt all carried over post Covid too. The first half of the 21/22 season was some of the most fun I\u2019ve ever had watching Cavs basketball. Then the injuries happened and the wheels fell off at the end of the year. \n\n\nWith the Mitchell trade, expectations changed and they failed to reach their goals. Not everything was JBs fault, but it often felt like they were winning despite him not because of him. Assuming Mitchell resigns and the roster is reworked, this team will go into next season with title aspirations and it\u2019s become evident that he isn\u2019t the guy to lead that charge. \n\nThis is all a long winded way of saying the Cavs are who they are today partially because of JBB. He may not get a team across the finish line but he will get them out of the gate and build an excellent baseline. Washington, Portland, Detroit, Charlotte would all greatly benefit from hiring him",
