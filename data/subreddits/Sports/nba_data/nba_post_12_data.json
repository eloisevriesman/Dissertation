It's just one of those things that refs are gonna see how much the contact affected the shot sometimes if it's not egregious. Why stop a playoff game for a foul that didn't alter the shooter that much?",

But then it uses \u201cimaginary cylinder\u201c for above the rim shots, even though spin, momentum, etc all can clearly still allow that a ball still \u201chas a chance to score\u201d which is the wording used within the rule.   \n\n\nThey\u2018d have to taper the imaginary cone out to a zone of statistical possibility for the logic to be consistent and then somehow make calls based on that, which I guess looks a lot more possible with this tech being shown here.
