The BBC lowballed them, so they picked up and moved to Amazon, called the show \"The Grand Tour,\" and are doing it however and whenever they want now. And this was after nearly 20 years of doing it, similar to this.\n\nIf Chuck owns the show, first of all it keeps him in the show no matter what (which was always the worry the last two contract negotiations), and he could sign a deal with anyone *with the three NBA rights owners* to air the show. Inside the NBA (or whatever the new name is) could be on ESPN, Amazon, NBC, wherever (please not Amazon, their live services are trash). And he could even work it so that all of the main four (himself, Shaq, Ernie and Kenny) all get cuts of the profits, both motivating them to make a better show than ever *and* make future negotiations even easier. Hell, Chuck could then even get all of the key guys from Inside the NBA (and the behind the scenes guys really are crucial).",

If WBD works out a deal to put it on one of the other three options, then sure, they stay as Inside the NBA. But the second Zaslav's stupid ass decides to can the show, they're free to go wherever. And that includes every single person on the show, too. The four hosts could absolutely fund a new version of the show with a different name, hire all of the old workers, and sell it to anyone (including the three rights-holders).\n\nActually, they could sell it to MORE THAN ONE of the rights holders.

Ernie was a perfectly competent analyst/host pre-Chuck (hard to consider him a host when he was solo 8 of those 10 years pre-Kenny, but w/e), but he was a straightforward suit who gave you the breakdown. \n\nThen they brought in Kenny as the ex-pro voice to give his take, and like Ernie, he was a suit guy, he chimed in with a made-for-TV neutral American accent. Still a fine show, now there's dialogue instead of just news, but nothing groundbreaking or novel.\n\nThen they brought in Chuck, who was nothing like Kenny, or at very least nothing like what Kenny was trying to present on TV at the time. He completely warped the dynamic with his personality. Without Chuck, you have a perfectly fine show about basketball, without Ernie, you have an entertaining podcast/talk show that may or may not even talk about basketball, but what people consider 'Inside the NBA' would not exist without either of those two. I don't think either are replaceable, Ernie is just so good at managing the personalities and keeping the show (mostly) on track, while still allowing the others to be themselves without losing control. I don't think that can be replaced, and as for Chuck, I don't think there's another person in the world like him.",

Don\u2019t even get me started on baseball. That is way too much of a cost for me when I have so many other forms of entertainment for much less and ad-free. The fact Prime gets the first round of the playoffs is ridiculous. The only benefit to this is you\u2019d get Sunday night basketball OTA when there\u2019s no NFL but just imagine Inside the NBA becoming an ESPN product just makes me want to throw up.\n\nI hope they go the route of simulcasting on YouTube and whatever other service.",
