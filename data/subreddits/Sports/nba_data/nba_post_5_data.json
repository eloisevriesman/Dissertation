Why waste time and effort to build a reputation and a loyal viewership/customer, when one single fuck up, especially with social media and fast traveling news can screw all that up in the blink of an eye? \n\nI get what you\u2019re saying, and I agree with you. Companies should focus on long term profits, instead of shorting and forcing a quick buck at every occasion. But when companies can literally just layoff 10% of their employees right before the end of a fiscal year to maximize profits, and that the ones responsible for those decisions get literally no consequences for it, because they can just decide to sell their shit at X times what they bought into, what\u2019s the point for them in doing things properly?

Heck no, some people would sell their friends and family off in exchange for property. \n\nIt has to do with regulations, because when everything is allowed, like hiring people, making them do work for you, and cutting them off after to maximize profits and abandoning those very people that contributed to your success, then people will resort to those strategies. If they were not allowed, or heavily discouraged with fines that wouldn\u2019t make it worth firing those people, companies would be forced to always think long term. \n\nNothing specific to NBA, admitted, it\u2019s pretty general",

That's why the strategies focus so heavily on profits and are less concerned with the balance of taking care of its employees and providing the best quality product for its customers. They slowly keep taking more and more away trying to see how much they can get away with before they lose enough customers that it offsets those savings.

At that level it\u2019s all about reputation, trust, and the ability to make really hard decisions for the business like laying off tens of thousands of people, alienating talent, and shuttering long standing brands and businesses. WBD are essentially paying Zaslav to allow his reputation to take all those hits in the pursuit of putting the business on a stronger financial foundation. We don\u2019t have to be empathetic to that because it\u2019s a shit ton of money, but I understand why it would cost that much to do it after a lifetime of building up your reputation in the industry.",

Honestly, the whole Time Warner/Discovery merger was a (successful) attempt by him to leverage his declining cable-network assets before they became almost worthless. In the age of streaming, *what is TNT* without sports providing original content? You can get your reruns of old shows anywhere. \n\nSo I see it as an attempt to prop up the value of his assets (which needed to be perceived as valuable in order to justify the merger) rather than being about the NBA per se.",

TNT had to pay close to triple its previous deal for less coverage (to be gouged again later) or lose its best product entirely and then sue.\n\n\n\u201cConsidering WBD is $40B in debt and does not have the over-the-air infrastructure of NBC, sources believe WBD would need to pay more than $2.6B to match the deal and that NBC's overall bid could be structured in a way (for example, multiple weekly over-the-air games) that makes it virtually impossible for WBD to equal. Sources said Zaslav would then essentially have three choices: pass on the NBA, drastically overpay for the \"B\" package or take the NBA to court over the definition of a match.\u201d",

Turner started their relationship with the NBA broadcasting Atlanta Hawks games. This expanded into a national contract by   the late 80s. The NBA was sort of a fledgling league as well and used the expansion of cable to broaden its reach. Turner hasn\u2019t been the same company since the AOL Time Warner merger. Subsequent mergers have made the decision making at Turner further from Atlanta.  Turner is just a small piece of a conglomerate.
