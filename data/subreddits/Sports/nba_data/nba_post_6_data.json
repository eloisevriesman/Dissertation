You know, I just feel so bad for the people I work with Dan,\u201d Barkley said, before criticizing his corporate bosses at WBD. \u201cThese people I work with, they\u2019ve screwed this thing up clearly. And we don\u2019t have zero idea what\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t feel good. I\u2019m not gonna lie, especially when they came out yesterday and said we bought college football. I was like, well damn, they could have used that money to buy the NBA.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019ve never had college football, never been involved with college football,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, wait a minute. Shouldn\u2019t we be spending every dime we\u2019ve got to keep the NBA? So morale sucks, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re just sitting back waiting on these people to figure out what they\u2019re gonna do,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cYou know, my two favorite wines are Inglenook and Opus [referencing two high-end California wineries], and these clowns I work for, they\u2019ve turned us into Ripple and Boone\u2019s Farm and Thunderbird [cheap fortified supermarket wines]. Like we got the best studio show \u2014 it\u2019s so funny we just won the best studio show [at the 2024 Sports Emmy Awards]. But these fools turn us from Inglenook and Opus into Boone\u2019s Farm and Ripple. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n> \u201cI think the first thing is you know they came out and said we didn\u2019t need the NBA. So I think that probably pissed [NBA commissioner] Adam [Silver] off,\u201d Barkley added. \u201cI don\u2019t know that, but you know when we merged that\u2019s the first thing the boss [David Zaslav] said, \u2018we don\u2019t need the NBA,\u2019 well he don\u2019t need it. But the rest of the people, me Kenny, Shaq, and Ernie and the rest of the people who work here, we need it. So it just sucks right now.\u201d",

Shaq refuses to ever give any credit to anyone and constantly throws childish insults, Kenny is a tool, and Chuck\u2019s only value is his occasional good take on something political or with regards to league rules and justice.\n\nI legitimately can\u2019t remember the last time I tuned into inside the NBA and heard them give actual accurate insight into strategy or anything to do with actual basketball, which makes sense considering every time they do a halftime show it seems like they\u2019re just watching a few highlights for the first time moments before they give their takes.\n\nEvery 10 games or so Shaq and Chuck have a funny exchange or Kenny does something dumb, but outside of that I seriously don\u2019t see the difference between inside the NBA and first take at this point.
