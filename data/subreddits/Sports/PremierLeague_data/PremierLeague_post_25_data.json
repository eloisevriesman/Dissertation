                            "body": "Brentford hardly have a shite team, and their league position had nothing to do with the quality of the squad (other than depth), at one point Brentford had the worst injury list in the premier league and given the stink that is made about Newcastle or United or even Liverpool's injury list this season, that's worth baring in mind. The season before that they had one of the leagues best defences, the fact it fell apart because 90% of the players were injured and they lost Raya also speaks volumes. Long term injuries to both starting wingbacks all season as well, it's really unfair to say they had a shite team, shite depth, yes, but their starting 11 is comfortably mid-table.\n\nYou also don't know what you're talking about regarding Toney, who was utter shit when he returned and has had one eye on a move since. Brentford played better football when he wasn't on the pitch with a Wissa - Mbuemo - KLP front 3 than they ever did when he started this season, and again Mbuemo was injured from December - March, and Wissa went to AFCON for part of that.\n\nThe fact Frank kept them up with plenty of games to go is a testament to his abilities as a manager, but there is no denying that it would have been dicier in a more normal year. Hopefully this a wake up call on the recruitment side of things, especially if Frank decides to go elsewhere, because the squad needs depth and strengthening in key areas this season, there is always a risk of stagnating and collapsing in the Premier League.",
