Boehly comes out the other week seemingly happy with the progress being made and saying he can see the plan is coming together when he watches how they play. He also takes Poch to dinner last week ahead of this meeting. No mention of Eghbali.\n\nThen this meeting happens. Eghbali turns up, apparently with a load of crap data about big chances missed and things which the manager cant actually be responsible for. Questioning the injury record under Poch when Chelsea have had the worst injury record in the PL for several seasons. Also, when Poch was at Spurs his methods were praised as being the reason Spurs players had significantly less soft tissue injuries. Maybe, just maybe it takes time for players bodies to adapt to new training regimens and these injuries were more just a continuation of injuries from the several seasons this injury situation has been going on. \n\nIt seems clear that Boehly is a scapegoat and its really scrambled egg brained Eggbali pulling the trigger on this stuff. He also probably went into that meeting knowing full well that Poch wouldn't budge on wanting to keep Conor Gallagher and Trevoh Chalobah but Eggy is intent on selling for profit. So he essentially constructed the conditions where Poch would choose to leave.",

You can look at the squad and see that there were holes and weaknesses and insane injuries, and assign blame to the players and board/SD's. But you can strip all that away and ask when subs were made, ask how lineups worked together, ask how issues were addressed/fixed, look at how set pieces were organised, etc.\n\nMost of that stuff was a net negative for me. That's absolutely not to say that Poch is awful or it was all bad - he is clearly good (or great) at man-mgmt, and the dressing room was all behind him. He has a rep for developing youth, and being objective, I'd say we could see some leaps from a few players. That stuff was a net-positive. \n\nDid the board put Poch in the best position to succeed? No - a flat no. Did Poch put the players in the best position to succeed? It's a no from me, although clearly many disagree with me these days. Did the players execute as best they could? I'd say, based on age and experience (including playing together), they probably exceeded this a bit.\n\nWould the players do better under Manager X instead? Show us Mgr X and we can make a good guess. The answer is certainly going to be mixed.",

It sounds like he expected to be part of the summer window and he was locked out, and then was disappointed with the haul. He didn't like their plans with Maatsen, he didn't like having a short squad. And then after the Wolves match, the board let him know they weren't happy with things, and from that point on, it was the board demanding/asking/suggesting that he do X or Y and him refusing. Clearly he didn't want to lose his prototypical player, but it sounds like that was only one issue of many.",
