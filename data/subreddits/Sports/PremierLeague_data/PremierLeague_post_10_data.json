He was a class above most other players but was unfairly remembered for a failed Panenka against WHU. He was inconsistent at times, but showed the potential to do what he did yesterday. \n\nScott Parker is a football criminal as our relegation cost us Lookman, Andersen, Areola, and Anguissa. He played bang average winger Cavaleiro up top instead of Mitro, which says it all really. Should never get a top flight managerial role ever again.",
