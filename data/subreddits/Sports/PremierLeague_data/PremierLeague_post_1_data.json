            "body": "In my opinion, I believe that they're going to basically have nothing happen to them, but that's actually what I want, for the sole reason that I want FFP scrapped.\n\nAt this point, a lot of people have the opinion that FFP was never to actually try and stop Portsmouth and Leeds from happening again, it was to prevent the likes of people like Roman and Sheikh Mansour from buying clubs and then using their money to compete with the already established clubs.\n\nThis is accented by the fact that the history of the sport for the most part is defined by teams who spent the most money winning the trophies, and the teams let the already corrupt UEFA put in a rule for the sole purpose of stifling the competition. \"Organic\" growth is almost impossible because every time a smaller club has a good season, bigger clubs poach their best players and those smaller clubs have to get recruitment perfect, or else they end up like Southampton and get relegated once the well of top academy talent dries up.\n\nIf you really wanted to prevent Portsmouth, Leeds, Rangers, etc from happening again, a much better way of doing things would be to make the owners put up the money on the spot. For example, if there is a player whose total transfer fee is 50 million GBP and their wages over the course of the contract after accounting for all incentives and bonuses comes out to be 30 million, the owner/club would have to put down 80 million in a bank account on the spot to prove they have the money for said player, and then at the end of the contract or when they sell the player, they'd get back the unspent wages or otherwise be able to use the transfer fee received for that player to prove they had that money. What this does is prevent owners from being awful by putting a ton of debt onto the club, while allowing for owners to do what they always did before 2010 and dump their own money in if necessary.\n\nThis is just my two cents on the matter because in general I think the rules shouldn't exist as they exist now as all it does is stifle clubs like Villa from having their owners spend a bunch of money to invest because they have to go off of the revenue the club made instead of being able to put their outside money in.",

                    "body": "All this does is effectively further entrench Man City and Chelsea or similar clubs because most actual business have to project out future revenue and cash flow before making for example equipment purchases that will be used over future years.  Arsenal is a great example, we got the short end of the stick with rise of Abramovich and Sheik Mansour.  We had Highbury 38,000 seat stadium, but to compete with Old Trafford in the 00\u2019s we built a new stadium.  We had to pay off the debt of the stadium so we had to be very careful about spending.  Abramovich with his stolen Russian billions did not.  With your rule only he and maybe Man United at the time could have bought expensive players.  Same when Sheik Mansour came along to lift Man City within 3 years from firmly mid-table at best team to title winners.  All business run on debt and loans while projects are going on before the revenue is collected.  My small consulting firm does.  I see no reason why soccer clubs should not be able to do that.  The problem is when the spending is not tethered to the reality of revenues.  Chelsea first and then Man City mastered this.  Chelsea through straight up owners \u201cloans\u201d and Man City through their \u00a3400 million related entity Etihad Airways sponsorship deal that was larger than Arsenals and Liverpools based on my recollection despite Man City not being a fair comparison in terms of on field success at the time.  Now Chelsea is using 7 year contracts, now banned, and selling its training ground to \u201citself\u201d to create paper cash flow.  City is using Girona FC to stash upcoming prospects.  \n\nWhat we need is common sense rules, like one club cannot own another, having independent evaluation of all sponsorship deals, etc.  stuff like that",
