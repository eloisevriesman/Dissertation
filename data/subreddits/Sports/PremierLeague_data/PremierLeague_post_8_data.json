As soon as results are not positive, the media articles will start coming out. I think he need to make a leap to a Brighton or a similar club first to prove himself in the epl. \n\nBut its seems everyone is looking for the next potential. \n\nI think if he comes in it will be on a short term agreement until INEOS/jim gets all the upper management team and a footballing plan in place.",
