If they had gone into administration someone would have purchased them before it got to the liquidation stage.\n\nThe club itself wasn't losing that much money.

The club could have made \u00a3200m profit, but the owners still would not have been able to pay the loan, as they owed more than that. The club was used as collateral against the debt, and that's how RBS forced a sale.\n\nAnd no fan tries to say the club is rich due to shirt sales. They have pretty much always had to sell to buy new players, even now.to.an extent.

We won an FA Cup, a league cup, a Cup winners cup and a Super Cup in that same period, as well as consistently finished above you. So even before Roman we were better than you. Fact.",
