You can only beat what's in front of you. They also beat Chelsea and City on the way to the final.\n\nSorry but this attempt to delegitamise his achievements is kinda pathetic. Sure, he doesn't have a world beating CV. But 99% of footballers would kill for what he has achieved.\n\nChrist I don't even like Bellamy but this drivel got me defending him \ud83d\ude02",
