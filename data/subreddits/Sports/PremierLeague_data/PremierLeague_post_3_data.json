It was always contested by the same 3-4 clubs going back more then 2 dacedes now. If you want competitive league go watch the Brazilian league or J-League then you will get the definition of competitive league. If you wanna know what the Brazilian league is like as an example it is like Nottingham Forest who just avoided relegation can win the league next season it honestly just shows the Brazilian league is trash and not strong which is the opposite of what you searching for..\n\nBut the truth is forcing a fake comeptitiveness goes against sportsmanship and meritocracy itself. Every team plays the beautiful game to win and reach perfection if not nobody would have played the game hence eventually always few teams will reach the level of perfection and ethablish a dynasty and just because Man City has ethablished a dynasty doesn\u00b4t mean a mockery of the league it just means one team reached perfection meaning they reached their goal.\n\nIf you looking for fake competitiveness you shouldn\u00b4t watch the great game because what you are saying in directly is someone should throw the games.\n\nIf nobody is allowed to excel then what is the point of playing football at all is the question that needs to be asked?\n\nIt is like the food chain someone eventually comes on top and you can\u00b4t change that no matter what example in Boxing, Tennis, NBA, NFL etc etc someone always comes on top of the food chain. Perfection, excellence and peak levels should be celebrated that is the true spirit of sport",

I never said Alonso would be chosen over Pep I said he is more talked about and you know why but because you have a hard on for Pep it won\u2019t let you say it. I have no doubt He is a great manager with the support of all his players, but again as I\u2019ve said countless times, who is the last team he took top that weren\u2019t suppose to. When did he take the underdog team to the top. When did he take a team with half or a quarter the budget of Man City to the top of the league or to a cup final. When he does that then he will be a champion manager, until then he will always be a good manager of a great team not the other way around. Prove me wrong",

As we all know the big companies just love hiring incompetent fucks while the most qualified candidates all famously take on mininum wage jobs. Thats how the world works \n\nBut, to answer your question: you might want to look further into his time at barca where he took an underperforming barca, got rid of the biggest stars on his first day, played some unknown youth players and went on to win the treble in his first year of coaching in the big leagues.",

Klopp is a good example of that, came to an underperforming team, bought well (not the best on the market) but players he felt would gel in his system and won trophies. And albeit on 1 PL title (one which you guy refuse to recognise because it was the Covid year) but they will build a statue of him out front if Anfield. That shows the stature of a man and a manager. More people watched Klopp\u2019s farewell than Man City win the title, why is that????\nGet back in your box",
