            "body": "Contrary to popular opinion, Kompany did actually adjust his style for the Premier League. He definitely went more defensive after the batterings by Chelsea and Spurs early on. We also set up very differently to the Championship season where it was mostly 4123 - we spent most of this season playing some sort of flexible 442.\n\n'What happened' is a combination of inexperience in the squad, difficult fixture list leading to destroyed confidence, poor transfer window(s) (with a record spend too!) and yes, some poor selection, tactical and management decisions from Kompany.\n\nI was still behind him and sad he is leaving, but let's not pretend he hasn't underachieved massively this season.\n\nSource: Season ticket holder for 10+ years",

Everytime it looked like they need a result and they have a chance, they bottled.\n\n\nAnd now with Kompany jumping ship at the end of the season, it looks like Burnley are in a worse place than they were a year ago.",

SAF always played the same tactics and in the same way relying on his players to do the job, he also had the best players of their generation during his time in Man U, it doesn\u2019t take away the work he did. Let\u2019s talk Ancelotti, it didn\u2019t go well for him at Everton but he\u2019s doing an amazing job in Real Madrid right now, why\u2019s that you think? Also, he has played like real do now most his coaching career too, especially Milan (he did try to change it in Everton) Look at all the coaches with most titles and those who have won the most, they have a style of play and an idea that they stick to, then they tweak and twerk it, change some players and stuff like that. Imagine Pep, SAF, Wenger, Mourinho after loosing a game just going; \u201cyea you are right I need to change it in order to be the best\u201d hahah are you hearing your self, call 911 or I\u2019ll do for you",
