That game Paqueta committed 4 fouls, above his average of ~ 1 a game, not completely unusual to happen though. \n\nThe problem was that multiple accounts were created the day before all with some relation to Paqueta, and all of whom bet the maximum amount on him to receive a yellow. \n\nSuper fucking fishy also add to the fact he was odds on 8/11 to receive a yellow (had 3 to this point), and all new accounts were created on Betway, sponsors of West Ham. \n\nDoesn't look good.",

A buddy of mine is a professional poker player, and by proxy, got involved in a lot of rather shady sports betting run by organized crime. \n\nSome of the names involved (hearsay from buddy) are rather high profile in English football - I suspect if folk Googled the intersection of sports betting and English football (not footballers, but very high profile folk in the actual football business), you\u2019d get a pretty good idea of who might be involved. But I\u2019d rather not name names given the public nature of this forum. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve heard, the betting rings involved could influence results of games, typically in lesser known leagues, but I\u2019ve heard anecdotes within top European leagues such as Serie A, though not explicitly in the EPL. Now when it comes to organized crime and the sums of money involved, sure there could be carrots to get footballers to influence a result, but there\u2019s also the stick. I wonder how many players might be coerced into some of these, rather than simply fall into this out of stupid greed. I don\u2019t think it applies to Paqueta given the details of the case, but it\u2019s worth a thought. \n\nAre there any other folk who have heard similar stories on betting syndicates?",

So, French league, FOR US, does a lot of fouls that the referee doesn't do. \n\nPaqueta went there to play in a mid team, got too \"hardcore,\" right?\n\nAbsolutely not. \n\nWhen he arrived at Orem, Me and other friends commented how he was constantly being booked for stupid fouls. Most of them made no sense. Not like in Lyon. He doesn't do just tactical fouls, he does stupid, nonsense, too violent fouls out of nowhere.\n\nLong ago we started commenting on betting for him being booked. It's no surprise he is involved with that. I've watched a lot of his games. He is far away from the player he was in Flamengo from a foul perspective. To me, he is absolutely involved with betting schemes.\n\nI ask for a WH fan here, do you think the fouls he does in the games are \"normal\"? I don't think so. Too bad for him bc he is a very good player that could go higher (with all respect for WH).",
