It\u2019s been in freefall since Ancelotti left and Moshiri (and whoever might be backing him) decided they wanted out. It was circling the drain in the two previous seasons, avoiding relegation on the second last match and last match respectively. He spent nothing in the summer, had to sell players such as Gordon to offset PSR. He had to manage through 2 points deductions. Dealing with one of these issues would be trying but dealing with all of them at the same time, still securing a 33% improvement in points won and achieving safety before the final rounds of matches is an achievement(all things being equal). It might be hard for non-Everton fans to understand but I feel that those fans who have lived the season will appreciate this.\n\nEdit: he also shored up the defence. Only City, Arse and those lovable reds had a better defence this season. Pickford pushed Raya for the golden gloves. He brought on the likes of Branthwaite and has improved Mykolenko and Tarkowski. Others may not appreciate his \u201cstyle\u201d (and it can be tough to watch sometimes) but it is effective in achieving results over 38 games. Ask Burnley fans would they rather Kompany\u2019s \u201cphilosophy\u201d of pretty football or Dyche\u2019s pragmatism of winning points.",

Over the last few seasons, the bulk of this Everton squad have shown themselves to be unreliable bottlers who have been dragged over the line *twice* by the supporters and some last-minute luck. Yet this season, those same players have been disciplined and resilient. They've played through **TWO** points-deductions and still not crumbled. \n\nAnd Dyche is the reason.\n\nWhere Benitez (still can't believe that happened) was pig-headed, obstinate, petulant, and prone to drama, Dyche is pragmatic and goal-driven, not ego-driven. And where Lampard was emotional, idealistic, and yearning for praise and acceptance from the fans and the board, Dyche has been level-headed, consistent, and neither pleading nor apologetic. He's not someone who is going to let off-field issues and emotions filter down to the players. It's *his* team, he's their buffer, and it looks like they're playing for him and for the shirt, and that's what we want to see as Evertonians.",

Also, had an attacking LB in Lucas Digne and a younger Coleman to push on. They helped Lewin to score the goals he did. Even then, he missed plenty of chances. 20 goals a season is punching above his weight. He\u2019s a 12-15 goal man at most.\n\nDyche had none of those attacking options and also had to rely on 38 year old Ashley Young and a defensive LB (Mykolenko) - they are hardly going to cut teams open. However, he found a system that those players could play effectively.\n\nAs for inaccurate figures, it\u2019s hard to claim someone is better if they finish alongside or, in Frank\u2019s case, way below. The table rarely lies. As for \u201cplaying better\u201d football, what is that? All those teams (including Emery\u2019s Villa) shipped more goals than Everton. Is good defending not part of \u201cbetter football\u201d? Or do you only consider tippy tappy, pass for the sake of it with little end product as \u201cbetter football\u201d? Does the PL award points for artistic merit now?\n\nYou are right about one thing though. We do have some good players. Most of them are defensive minded though - explains the tight defensive record. We lack pace and creativity in midfield and upfront. As I mentioned those type of players were sold in order to try (unsuccessfully, as it panned out) to meet PSR rules and also because the owner wants out. As for standards and principles, you can afford to have those when you\u2019re not on the brink of financial oblivion thanks to 30 years of low ambition and incompetent administrators. The main aim for the club is to try to survive long enough to get into the new stadium and hopefully secure new owners who can instil some form of modern, professional approach to running a football club. Unfortunately, that is the current reality, as sad as it sounds for a club of the size and history which Everton has. To suggest anything else is delusional.",

That\u2019s why big clubs and top clubs are rarely interested in the likes of Dyche or Moyes or Fat Sam. It\u2019s why Bayern want Kompany and not Dyche.\n\nDyche signed players to suit the way he plays. Workmanlike. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But let\u2019s not pretend he didn\u2019t have options. I\u2019m a Leeds fan and basically our whole squad was available for loan in the Summer.

Dyche signed Young.\u00a0\n\nEverton had money to afford James's fee and wages. Since the Ukraine war, they are skint (I'll leave it to others to speculate on the link between the two events). Last summer's transfer dealings relied on loans, frees and \"zero down pay the rest on the never never\". Lack of money affects who you can sign, especially in the premier league.\n\n>Frank performed better because he has worse players\u00a0\n\nMost Evertonians would happily swap Mbeumo, Wissa and Toney for Doucoure, Lewin and McNeil. Brentford have other decent professionals in Cristian Norgaard and Rico Henry too. Granted their central defence and keeper aren't up to much but you make them out to be at Luton's level. That squad finished 9th last season.\n\n>And Frank shows more tactical variety and innovation. Good football is attacking football and, yes, \u201ctippy tappy\u201d football, ie passing and possession.\n\nDyche cut his cloth according to the squad's strength this year. That was basically stay in shape, let the other team have the ball, wait for them to make a mistake and try to profit from it. I would be disappointed if he played that way with the Man City squad but unfortunately Jimmy Garner is not Rodri, Doucoure is not Foden and McNeil is not Silva.\n\n>Dyche signed players to suit the way he plays. Workmanlike. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But let\u2019s not pretend he didn\u2019t have options.\u00a0\n\nAny options he may have had were extremely limited by the fact, and I am not sure if I mentioned this already, THE CLUB IS SKINT.\n\n>I don\u2019t really buy the \u201cyou have to play rubbish football to get results\u201d shtick.\n\nReal Madrid played what you call \"rubbish football\" to beat Man City and get to the CL final. They put 10 behind the ball, gave possession to City and said \"do something\". City couldn't, Madrid are in the final and I guarantee not one of their fans gives two shiny shites.\n\n>Also, playing good football tends to create better assets to sell...\n\nThe sad reality is that Branthwaite is likely to be sold. Happily, he is likely to fetch a big fee. The same would go for the likes of Pickford and Onana. By your logic, Dyche has contributed to growing the value of these assets.\n\n>Anyway, you\u2019re lucky it was a very weak season at the bottom. Next year should be more fun.\n\nDon't you mean that Forest were lucky it was a very weak season? After all, they finished below Everton as did your dad, Frank, and can be thankful that the bottom three were so weak. Anyway, it's going to be another challenging close season because of the ownership situation. Not predicting anything next season until we see what the squad is likely to look like.",
