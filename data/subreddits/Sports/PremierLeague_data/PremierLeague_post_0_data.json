It wouldnt have mattered if FFP or similar had arrived in 2008, 2003, 1992, 1981, 1946, 1920, 1888. If there ever came an owner that was willing to break and bend the regulations. Although I do recall reading it somewhere regulation on Ownership in Engish football upto 1980s were actually pretty strict but during the 1980s they started lose up the regulations then came 1992 rebranding of English topflight followed by some external changes such as Bosman and UEFAs rebranding European Cup to Champions League and aboltion of Cup Winners Cup. So top-level football had created a perfect grounds for rough owners to arrive. and that of curse happened with the arrival of Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003, and it has only gotten worse since then,   So I would argue that the 115 charges of man city are just consquences of football authorties daft decisons in 1980s and 1990s to create perfect condition for rough owners to take control of the game. \n\nas for Manchester United post Ferguson we need to get out of this idea that United spend the money. They dont spend they waste it aka flush it down the toilet like drug addict trying to resstore itself to former glory.",

They also beat Arsenal twice and City once, whilst drawing against Liverpool (we'll gloss over the away results against Newcastle, Liverpool and home to Spurs). He's also mostly done it with the same squad that Gerrard had - Newcastle fans kept on saying how Howe had coached a number of Bruce's players, so shouldn't we give the same praise to Emery? \n\nReally it comes down to expectations - most people expected City and Arsenal to challenge for the title and they did. They were relentless and gained a number of points, but I think this also points to the massive imbalance between the big clubs and the rest of the Premier League, rather than just their excellence. I think Emery is one of the few managers who exceeded expectations, along with Dyche and Edwards. \n\nFor my controversial opinion - I don't understand the relevance of comparing points totals from one season to another. Different squads, different players, different teams - the only measurement of progress or not across seasons should be where you finish. I'm sure someone with a statistical background will tell me where this isn't controversial and just wrong!",

But personally I don't think he's done enough to win it.",

Their argument is \"well, I'm just as *much* of a fan as the people  who go every week! My voice matters just as much as theirs!\"\n\nNo, you're not. You aren't the ones who built those clubs. You aren't the ones who keep the soul of the club alive. You aren't the ones who create the atmosphere. You aren't the ones whose lives are embedded in the club and its local community. You aren't the ones who have supported the club, often through thick and thin, for their whole life.\n\nWhat heinous people would call \"legacy fans\" are the ones who have given the most to their respective club, and stand to lose the most.\n\n*That's* why I believe that there is a distinction between \"levels\" of support.\n\nIt will just lead to soulless games played out in front of tourists with no atmosphere and everyone will be wondering \"how did football get so lifeless?\"\n\nWe're already in the process of this, because in greedy people's minds, the tourists who show up to a game of a club they've only been following for a few years is \"just as much of a fan\" as the local who has been going for 20+ years who has now been priced out. All because that tourist will spend more money.\n\n>While sometimes discrediting foreign fans looks like borderline racism....\n\nWheeey first one to call it racism \ud83d\ude02\n\n>People give their time and money abroad as well to watch their teams cant imagine how much it costs to have merch and subscriptions needed to stay connected....some people stay awake all night to watch a match....\n\nGood for them, they however imo should not have just as big of a say on the management of the club or league as \"\"\"legacy fans\"\"\", the ones who have been supporting the club for decades, the ones who provide the atmosphere at games and the ones who actually helped to create the culture that capitalists have turned into an extremely profitable product.\n\nThere's only one reason why higher ups at clubs want there to be no distinction, because all they give a shit about is making more money.

It works in certain sports and leagues because they are either niche enough (US sports) or financially bare enough to sustain it.\n\nThe moment you apply a salary cap in the PL it will cease to attract the top talent, and from there its a slippery slope to a worse standard. Also, consider cultural factors. Newcastle and Arsenal go for the same player, offer them the same money. 9 out of 10 will pick the London club. \n\nAlso note the definition of a salary can be as fluid as yours and the player's accountant want it to be. Pretend they get a massive chunk of image rights (which subsequently can't be properly taxed), pay fees to a company in the players name?",

With recent manoeuvrings from NBC to bring Premier League games to the USA, a nearing majority of US owners in the league, and emphasis being placed on the market, we\u2019re about to see the fabric of a key piece of English social capital torn apart.\n\nFootball is a global game, and the Premier League has attracted global fans for many years now, most notably with an influx of eastern Asian fans in the early 2000s. This is a large part of why the Premier League has become so financially dominant. However, no other countries fan bases\u2019 have been as hands on, and desired to change the domestic game to the same extent.\n\nI will caveat this by saying there are plenty of American fans who are opposed to the direction of travel also, and respect the position the game holds within our culture. However, I fear we are heading towards imminent cultural colonialism.",

Last year his subs were horrific, far too late especially when onfield players like Odegaard had dropped their heads. In my eyes it cost the league especially when Saliba missing was fixable if he trusted Kiwior at CB but he instead opted for Rob Holding who was god awful.\n\nThis year it was his tactics. We didn't have a functional attack for 6 months. People were praising \"big 3 points and shutting teams out\" when I was watching 70 minutes of the horseshoe of death and nervy finishes. He played Havertz LCM for 6 months which could theoretically work but not with way Arsenal play.\n\nHe also played Nketiah up top for 3 months and while I admire the trust, Nketiah is useless against low blocks needing lots of space to perform and doesn't track back. Then there's loads of individual mistakes but I'll only mention this one that really annoyed me. After weeks of freescoring with Havertz up top and him seeing a big resurgence we chose to play Jesus up top against Villa away in a big game that would decide the title. A guy who hadn't scored in months. Evidently with Jesus's chops and Havertz be given too much creative responsibility. There wasn't enough chances created and villa smelled blood and took us for two.",

That person has contributed so much more to the club than you.\n\nThere's been plenty of discourse around how real fans are being driven out by ticket prices and are being replaced by tourists who are casual fans who don't contribute to the atmosphere, are you going to say \"there's no problem, those tourists are just as big fans as the fans who have been going for 20+ years who were driven out\"?\n\n>And they don't contribute to the atmosphere at the games for my benefit.. Thats stupid too... They do it to show their love for the team.\n\nYes, that's true. And they're also a big part of the reason why you watch at home on TV.\n\n>Just as much as I do at home.\n\nOh yea, it's TOTALLY the same \ud83d\ude02\n\n>. U seem privileged.. Not understanding that people can be massive fans even if they cannot afford to attend games or buy merch..\n\nIt's telling that you don't include location in your arguments. I would absolutely accept the argument from a Scouser who lives locally and has supported Liverpool/Everton their whole lives, have gone to loads of games but can no longer afford it. That person *is* a big fan who has unfortunately been driven out by the worst of capitalist tendencies (i.e. the intentional move to suck money out of tourist fans at the extent of local fans)\n\nI will not accept that argument from someone who doesn't live in the same country (yet alone the same city), has gone to zero games, has only supported the club for a few years and screams rabidly about how they're \"JUST AS MUCH OF A FAN\" as a local whose whole life has been embedded in the club.\n\nYou. Are. Not. The. Same. And that's OK. You can still be a fan, just don't have delusions.\n\nI'm not as big a Newcastle fan as a local Geordie who has gone to every home game for 20+ years. It would be incredibly tone deaf for me to suggest that. And I'm completely fine with it, they're the ones who keep the soul of the club alive.\n\n>Try passion matters.. Doesn't matter where it is shown.\n\nIt absolutely matters. You are not \"showing the same passion\" as someone who has been going to games for 20+ years, or has supported the club their whole life and their whole family is centered around the club.\n\n>You are not a true fan.\n\nLol wrong. You are also a \"true\" fan, just as not as much of a fan as others.",

It sometimes seems like they are constantly searching for ways to improve the club, perhaps consulting too many advisors.\n\nWhen they fired Tuchel, they had already bought established star players like Sterling, Koulibaly, and Cucurella to add experience to the team. However, things didn\u2019t go as planned, and these players failed to elevate the team. Realizing their mistake with these experienced players, they opted for a coach who had succeeded in building a smaller team with limited resources.\n\nThey then hesitated to wait and were possibly influenced by the fans' impatience with Potter. So, they decided to hire someone the fans liked, thinking that if he succeeded, great; if not, they would go for a more experienced coach. But what happens when this experienced coach, who isn't known for winning anything, shows signs that his team won\u2019t win either? What do you do when the experienced coach fails to implement a football philosophy or tactics in a year? What do you do when the experienced coach isn't shrewd or capable enough to outmaneuver a youthful team in a cup final?\n\nIt doesnt help that management keeps trying different strategies and possibly listens to the fans when it\u2019s the coach who lacks a plan, strategy, and identity.

Cycling is ultimately about fuelling a guy to go as fast and long as possible on a bike. There\u2019s tactics and strategy involved too but you throw PEDs into a rider and it\u2019s a pretty basic return on performance.\n\nFinancial doping in football gets you players, coaches, facilities and everything else but you still have to bring it all together, and high performance is guarantee. Look at Chelsea, PSG, even the Galactico period at Real Madrid. Manchester City would never have had the chance to have the materials to work with had Abu Dhabi not juiced their finances but to actually produce what they have using that backing is pretty extraordinary. You can argue that Armstrong being the fastest doper was extraordinary too though I guess but I still think the many many more things to get right in football make it a less than perfect comparison.\n\nThen again, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if actual doping claims pop up eventually to tarnish a lot of football\u2019s most impressive recent teams too\u2026",

I'm just saying the instances where teams played their \"best\" football against City and won are incredibly rare, and it would be impossible to attribute that all to \"everyone else just didn't try to get a positive result\".\n\nPeople said the exact same thing about Fergie's United.\n\n>I\u2019m just saying whenever I watch City play a mid table side away I\u2019m never convinced performance wise the opposition is playing their best ball. Again with all due respect I attest this to a psychological fear more than anything.\n\nThere's a psychological element that affects lower league teams playing against any of the big boys. Sorry but I think it would be naive to say that City are the only ones it happens to.\n\nAgainst City it's most often just a lose lose.\n\nPlay your \"best\", most fluid football and lose (which is statistically the most likely outcome)?\n\n\"They were so naive, you can't play like that against City and not expect to get punished.\"\n\nPlay a low block and try to hit them on the counter (which is a direct attempt to exploit their one semi-weakness)?\n\n\"So negative, where's the courage to play with the ball?\"",

Ok, they won the last five, but they closed the first 19 games with 25 points and they obtained 22 points in the next 13 games. 22 points in 13 games is an average that would yield 64 points in a season, so it's still not satisfactory for a team aiming at UCL. Moreover, Chelsea's defense was abysmal, and basically they won 5 games in a row when every meaningful target was gone, and this is a disaster for a team that wasbleeding money even reaching the UCL quarter finals.\n\nThere are so many managers that can perform a better job than Pochettino, given the freedom he had on the transfer market and the infinite amount of money Chelsea spent.\n\nThe fact that Newcastle and Man United were beyond disgusting (and that the Premier League in general this year was nauseating, with 14 teams with 60+ goals against) cannot be a justification.",

Most other clubs injuries were spread between key players, squad players and players that never get minutes. Liverpool for a good 2 months could only play 4 or 5 of their starting XI. To the point where they were forced to field 17 and 18yo debutants in the league cup FINAL.\n\nAnother thing to add is a lot of teams had their injuries spread across the season, all of liverpools seemed to happen at the same time. This is obviously going to impact them much more. I think the main point here though is it\u2019s the injuries compared to title rivals that people talk about. Arsenal had hardly anyone injured. Average availability of their starting XI was 94%. As for City, average availability of their starting XI was 84%. Liverpools was at 56%.\n\nLiverpool getting worse when their players returned is a completely separable point and doesn\u2019t magically mean their players weren\u2019t injured.",

Or outlasted the 7-0 but I\u2019m not a United fan, so long may he stay. Newcastle should upgrade managers too. \n\nEddie Howe isn\u2019t going to take them any further, no matter how many British people downvote me. Horribly overrated, brutish, mash and gravy tactics spruced up with the odd triangle. Same goes for Thomas Frank, another guy who gets away with playing ISIS-ball. \n\nSalah/Son seem to be declining at the same rate. Someone here will quote stats about this or that but the eye test here tells me they\u2019ve lost a half yard of pace and are adjusting to it. Son has looked good in some stretches and seems to be slipping into a part of the ensemble, while Salah seems more adrift than ever. Anyway different players but just found it interesting to point out the similar minor but noticeable dip. \n\nLaughing at Arsenal fans is the best. Why? Because according to them everyone is the best, every new player will be the best, you can say hello to an Arsenal fan and they\u2019ll say did you know we\u2019re the youngest team to blah blah blah. Goes to show how meaningless stats are that the most predictable player in the league somehow statpadded so much G/A. I\u2019ll give you a hint, he chops and cuts inside and spams shot or taps it back to another player or, and most often, just dives. \n\n\nFinally this Liverpool coach is going to absolutely suck. They hired their previous coach who brought UCL final experience, now they got a bald guy from the Dutch plumbers league. Worked out great for United and this guy is who\u2019d lose to ten Hag. Imagine being that shit. Hope you enjoyed the run, because it\u2019s over. You could have 59 inhalers and you\u2019ll still finish like 7th just off talent quality alone.
