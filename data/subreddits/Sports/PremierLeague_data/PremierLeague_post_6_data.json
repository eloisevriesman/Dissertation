Why get players used to playing a way in the Premier League... When you are just going to get relegated again? \n\n>The board fully backed him doing it as it was never the plan to get promoted in his first season after having a massive rebuild where they lost all of their premier league players more or less. \n\nYeah I am sure the board is thrilled to get relegated immediately again. I am not saying that he should necessarily have gotten sacked or anything, but having more of a real gameplan during some games could have allowed them to finish 16th or 15th for sure.\n\n>Bayern are after him because he has a distinct style of play and at the top level teams tend to like managers that will play a certain way\n\nAnd what a massive mistake it would be, to hire a coach that is inflexible during a time where Bayern are at risk of slipping away heavily in a league they have dominated for so long.",

For 5 years they have been trying to find his perfect position in the midfield and have failed. 1 year, 2 years you can blame the managers and system, but after half a decade, you have to look at the player.\n\nBecause he is a top earner. De Jong came right before Barca basically had to admit that the club had been completely destroyed. They definitely tried to sell him but would only take really high bids and he didn't want to leave. Liverpool and pre-ten Hag United were willing to agree a sum of some 80 million euros. Not bad for a player that has been in a struggling team for years.\n\n>Ajax run was impressive, but calling all of their players world class based on one run is far too short sighted. And with time we have seen that they don't have it in them. I don't think they have lived up to the hype. I'm not saying they are bad players, but to call them current leading footballers is rating them a little too much.\n\nNot just based on that run, they impressed for years on end. The year prior they had been in the EL-final with de Ligt being a starter in that game aged 16. This was before ten Hag, though. Two years later, they won every game in their CL-group with none other than Haller scoring something like 8 goals. Ten Hag made Dusan Tadic, of centre midfield Southampton fame, into one of the most effective strikers in Europe. Barcelona AND Real wanted to sign him in this period, despite him being early 30's at this point. The idea that all of these players necessarily would have to be world class forever is silly.\n\n>And Ten Hag did have merit to win Eredevise but he hasn't shown it with competition in the Prem or CL. The quality of the leagues is miles apart. Not to mention, all his signings have failed terribly at Man Utd. \n\nLast season United finished a very respectable third. But yes, as has been happening for over a decade now, big name transfers have failed under ten Hag. Casemiro, Varane, Eriksen, Sancho- utter failures. Heavily overpaid for players like Antony or Hojlund. Had Antony been 20 million he'd have been a fun, talented substitute player. \n\n>We have seen his merits in the Dutch league, but in Prem and in Europe he has shown he's not a top manager.

You have to be blind to not see his competence in Ajax, at the same time, if you think he hasn't been pretty poor at Man Utd, you have to be blind again.\n\nThis season has been a terrible failure. There are some silver linings though and you do have to wonder if it had been much better under a different coach. Tons of injuries and instability. I don't know if he should get a third season, but the problems run deeper than ten Hag and him berating Jadon Sancho for playing FIFA at night.",

It's at home with top clubs as those names I mentioned above show. Liverpool especially has given a number of them a try, Chelsea with Frank Lampard and Graham Potter.\n City as well in their earlier days of investments. Stuart Pierce and Mark Hughes. Game has gone beyond them. The high level tactics passed them by. We'll see how Howe does if and when he gets his opportunity after Newcastle.",

Most of the development which happened at academy and lower level for football took place in Spain and Germany. It's why we see so many great coaches coming from those two countries. That period from the late 90s to around 2010 was crucial towards the development of the modern game. England missed out on a lot of that development unfortunately. I think it's starting to turn around though. Howe, Rob Edwards, Gary O'Neil, I think England is getting itself together again and we'll see more tactically astute managers in the coming years",

But, I can see how effective employing (essentially) top-level tactics in the Championship paid dividends and how continuing that coaching style and mode of play in the PL makes a lot of sense...but Burnley had to shed quite a lot of loanees on transistion and my viewpoint was that he needed to look at his players and re-tool his team towards getting results. But, you could definitely see flashes of what could be.\n\nBayern would be taking a risk on a young, hungry manager who has learnt from the best but maybe given top level talent could transform Bayern into a dynamic, fast transistion side. Why not? The only way to get experience is to get experience. Fuck it, he's whip smart, articulate and seems like he shouldn't be fucked with - it's a massive risk, but I respect it.",

It just sucks we're left relegated with a load of players he signed. Still, there's optimism and if the reports are true we should be getting \u00a320M or so in compensation from Bayern for his departure. \n\n>IMHO (as a pathetic armchair tactician, tragic FPL mid-tabler and sometime Sunday League player) he should stick with Burnley, take the relegation as a massive lesson in humility and an opportunity to form this team into fittest, smartest and bad-ass team to yo-yo back up and then aim for 15th place.\n\nI agree. If things go pear-shaped at Bayern, this is a big risk for his future career. Many of the fans have the feeling this job is too big for him right now. But only time will tell obviously. \n\n>As a side note: Does Turf Moor have the best view from the top of the stand of any team, anywhere??!\n\nYes! The view from the top of the Long Side (North Stand) - which is where I usually sit- is widely regarded as one of the best in English football.

The money the club was bought with and the money VK spent on players was not from the Mormon church. It was a leveraged buyout funded by player sales and external loans.\n\nYou are totally misrepresenting where VK got funds from. It was not from \"duping the Mormon church\".",
