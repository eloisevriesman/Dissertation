So a lad from the midlands chose to move 350 miles north to avoid playing for his boyhood team's rivals (I use the word rivals in the loosest sense of the word).",

He's and attacking mid or winger and he'd be behind Harvey. \n\nAlso, he's about 18 months younger than Salah, so you aren't really replacing him with an option that can grow. \n\nI imagine he's likely headed back to the MLS or maybe to a top 10 but not CL team in France, Germany, or Italy. Hell, I'll add Wrexam as a total shithouse answer.",
