The general consensus amongst us match going fans is that Bruno is paramount to the team. Your contrarian opinion is not only controversial even by rival standards, but is of no importance to the team. If we keep Bruno and we remain shit, then it\u2019s a win for you no?\n\nEdit - I\u2019ve just seen your edit now where you admit the issue with United has been the flanks and the requirement to replace multiple roles. Can you not see the juxtaposition in comparison of your original stance that Bruno is the problem? It feels like you\u2019re agreeing with me in everything except your conclusion\u2026\n\nAm not bothering to reply anymore - it\u2019s clear you haven\u2019t got a clue in the process of rebuilding a team. Getting rid of our only avenue of attack \ud83e\udd74 alarm bells should be ringing when people linked with United who have forgotten more about football than you will ever know say the exact opposite of your opinion.",

You could be able to get it to work, if you had a double DM where their job is more to clean up second balls outside the box and win possession back immediately. That again limits you mostly to counter attacking and reduces your creativity centrally.   But you\u2019re not trying to find a 10\u2026. 10s are mostly done on the league.  You can do it in a 3421 but not in any type of 3 man midfield.  And the reason you can\u2019t is because you get overwhelmed in the midfield\n\nI would look at Lucas Paqueta, Reider, Fabbian, Rohl\u2026 these are guys I would look to add balance to the midfield and not rely on one guy who clearly can\u2019t do it.  You can say it\u2019s a downgrade from Bruno, and they currently are but the point isn\u2019t about keeping Bruno\u2026.  In 4 years, if United buy 1 of every position and nail it correctly, in 4 years bruno is 33 and at best a role player. Who\u2019s been phased out as a primary 10 to a CM on Wed to play brentford.  Sure that could work, it\u2019s better to cut and run and rebuild.  Same goes with Rashford.\n\nYou clearly don\u2019t understand.  Say 10 is winning the league. You can have Bruno who is a 9 but because of the his limitations and tactics it forces you to have a bunch of 6/7s around him playing through him.  This isn\u2019t Ted Lasso\u2026.  Multi role players are needed.",

He is so massively often disrespected, ironically, a bit like Harry Kane. \n\nUnder Poch, your team doesn't sit back, it goes toe to toe with the best and competes. Be it City, be it Real Madrid or Barcelona. He is not obsessed with possession but still plays attacking football. Creates so many chances. Under him Spurs had one of the best defenses in the league and he built and grew that young team from the ground up. \n\nAnyone who has watched Chelsea knows they competed with the likes of City, Liverpool, beat Spurs and general play was good. He didn't have a striker and so many injuries. Two cup runs and 3 points of Spurs (who got massive accolades). \n\nPersonally I am happy that things ended with Chelsea for him. But I always believe he deserves to be top. A Bayern job would be great for him. A knack of improving players, getting the best out of them, reaching finals, going extremely close (yes, falling at the last hurdle but watch those who follow not even get close).",

However we also leaked a LOT of goals, often in a similar fashion, which showed a certain weakness in his coaching.\n\nWe were very much Chaos FC in almost every game which is very entertaining but not very consistent. \n\nInterested to see how he does wherever he goes though, if the same issues are there or if they somehow vanish.",
