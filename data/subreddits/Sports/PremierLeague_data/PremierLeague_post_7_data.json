For me, it's all well and good to have sporting directors to plan and carry the long term vision of the club. I also think it's okay for them to have a major influence on recruitment decisions. But there needs to be a balance on where their authority stops.\n\nFor me it is that once they identify a suitable manager that they think is appropriate, they should allow the manager the freedom to make their decisions. However, Chelsea is moving into a system that involves the sporting directors so much even in the day to day activities of the manager including training and tactics.\n\nWhich I personally think is absolutely ridiculous. Because at that point, the manager isn't really given any space to think or challenge the norm set out by the hierarchy. And he is forced to produce results in that system which might not even be the right way.\n\nAnd in the end, who takes the blame? The manager.\n\nI don't think the owners are right for enforcing such a sporting director-centric approach where they get to even dictate decisions that the manager should take.\n\nThey're going to create an environment that top coaches will not enjoy - thereby dissuading them from joining Chelsea. Anyway, it doesn't look like Chelsea want an 'elite' coach as they are looking for someone 'progressive'.\n\nThat's what I think at least. Let me know what you all think.",

                    "body": "Finally an article that actually tried to discuss the real issue, which is the more \u201cprogressive\u201d organisational structure that the ownership is trying to implement. \n\nWhat they are trying to introduce is a structure that is more compartmentalised and collaborative across departments and levels (main team to youth setup). What this means is that various personnel will come together on a wide variety of issues to give their input, but ultimately the responsibility for the final say will fall to the relevant \u201ccompartment\u201d. \n\nFor example, when discussing squad building, the football directors, manager, recruitment team, managers of different youth levels, etc will come together to discuss the state of the current team, and plan transfers and departures. The beauty of it is that this collaborative approach does not just emphasise the needs the first team, but considers it from the perspective of the entire organisation. It might perhaps seek to fill a positional gap in the youth teams, or perhaps discuss the tactics of the youth setup to align with the first team, etc. Basically, ownership is trying to build a baseball organisation in football. Football might be becoming more compartmentalised with positions like director of football becoming more common, but it\u2019s still a far cry from the way baseball orgs are run, where you have pitching and bullpen coaches, hitting coaches, base coaches. Compare that to how Poch was pushing back on the idea if a set-piece coach.\n\nSo this is the vision that ownership had for Chelsea. In this structure, the role of manager is afforded a lot less control than traditionally given to a manager, but are expected to be involved in a greater operational breadth and provide input. As you might expect, this more \u201cprogressive\u201d job scope might not be acceptable to many managers in the industry. That\u2019s likely why Chelsea are looking to hire young managers - 1. For longevity, 2. Likely greater willingness to adapt to the club system compared to veteran managers.\n\nUnlike the various speculations that people put forth to explain the departure of Tuchel and Poch, I strongly believe that the true reason is simply a misalignment of philosophy regarding how the organisation is run, which is exactly the reason given by the club, but for some reason doubted and ignored by fans. Tuchel was likely not willing to involve himself in the operations of the organisation, only willing to take on the responsibilities of a first team coach and only any tasks relevant to that role. And I don\u2019t know which aspect of the team structure Poch is against, but my guess would be the way Chelsea wants to compartmentalise, especially with recruitment and coaching, seeing how he did not want a set-piece coach to begin with. Questions might be asked as to why Chelsea hired Poch to begin with if this misalignment exists. It is a fair question, and I am not going to pretend I know the answer. It could be that we needed a manager and Poch was the best available at the time, and now that better candidates we like are available, we mutually part ways to pursue those candidates. Or perhaps Poch did not fully understand what working in the organisation\u2019s structure entailed until he was actually here. Hard to tell.\n\nNow there are various critiques that can be levelled on Chelsea. On a more macro level, there are huge question marks over whether the baseball system is fully transferrable, especially when it comes to recruitment. Baseball recruitment is very organisation-centric, but there just aren\u2019t that many player moulds in baseball, and while the tactics and strategy are deceptively nuanced to the unfamiliar, it\u2019s not the same as in football where the lack of certain types of player could break a particular style. So there is an argument here that in terms of recruitment, you might want it to be a little more manager-centric. Remember that in this structure, the manager is involved in the recruitment discussion, but does not have the final say. I would also criticise the failure to bring in a couple of experienced players this season the ease the transition into a young squad. I fully understand the transfer policy of the team and do think it\u2019s a good idea. After all, players tend to mature by their mid 20s, so you buy up these talents in their early 20s that will mature to become the core of the team in 2 years time (think Enzo, Caicedo, Jackson, Palmer), then you buy up these 16-18 year olds to form the next generation (think Paez, Estevao). However the team could have used a few veterans to guide the team through this phase.\n\nUltimately, i do agree with the direction of the tram and the structure being set up. I think a more collaborative and compartmentalised structure like in baseball is going to be more effective in the long run for the continued success of the club, but it is essential that this structure is being sufficiently adapted to the football context.",

I'm all for that. Here's a youtube video of the same guy being interviewed. I think most top clubs are adopting his \"finisher\" methodology [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysEbioz4qnw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysEbioz4qnw)\n\n  \nI view our set piece specialist in a similar vein. I doubt the set piece guy will be dictating exactly what corner routine is run when. It also sounds like he will also have some involvement with Cobham - I think that's smart too - make our amazing academy products better at set pieces.  \n\n  \nIn a way it was similar under Roman, if a Manager with a lot of control wanted to play a certain way, and we did not win - they gone pretty fast.  Roman had his guys that he fell in love with - strikers mostly, and Managers were kind of stuck playing Shevchenko and Torres...  \n\nEmanalo assembled the dream young team, and we all lament in hindsight that they gave into Mourinho power and shifted out KDB and Salah. Marina was always buying for the loan Army (remember the 2017 transfer window!), plenty of our Managers were stuck with Frankenstein squads... just another example of the authority of boards of the past.\n\n  \nEmbrace change.",
