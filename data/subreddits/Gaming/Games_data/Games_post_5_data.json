Tears of the Kingdom makes its shift to a physics based world look easy. The shift to making *everything* physics based was an enormous achievement, and its often overlooked when people describe the sequel as more \"iterative\" than \"innovative\". I don't think there's very many studios who would've taken the risk Nintendo did with its \"multiplicative\" gameplay, and few that would be capable of delivering on that promise. \n\nSince we're in a PlayStation thread... frankly, I'm not confident studios as good as Naughty Dog or Santa Monica could've made Tears of the Kingdom.",

But those people are few, and it is very hard to justify a third playthrough or more.\n\n**2) You can watch a playthough online without the need to purchase or play the game.** If the story is all there is to a game, what is there to stop your average person from seeing it on YouTube or reading a summary on a Wiki, and save themselves 50\\~70 dollars?\n\nBoth of these issues are absent in a gameplay-focused videogame:\n\n**1) You can continue to play and re-play a game as long as it is fun.** Just watch how often your average Joe/Jane will go back to their favorite childhood/teenager-years game. This is specially evident in competitive multiplayer games like Street Fighter, Apex Legends, League of Legends, Assetto Corsa, etc.\n\n**2) You cannot get the same experience watching someone play a game compared to playing it yourself.** An online playthrough or summary will NEVER be as engaging as performing the actions and overcoming the challenges yourself.",

They're fun, don't get me wrong, but I feel like they don't really innovate or expand gameplay in interesting ways, for my tastes anyways.

Not sure how to describe it, but everything is animated to happen in a specific way, and there aren't a lot of emergent gameplay opportunities. Feels very \"scripted\" a lot of the time, if that makes sense. I still enjoy them but I did thing that by this console gen and the CPU power we have now, we'd be seeing them do more in terms of AI and interesting mechanics that use physics to their advantage.",

I imagine this is increasingly difficult as teams have gotten larger. Its also one of the reasons that a lot of indie boomer shooters tend to have challenging scenarios. They are small 2-3 man teams that can work to make the levels fit the AI.\n\nShogun 2: Total War is another such game.

Sony pressured Insomniac to lay off it's staff because running studio in California is expensive (shocker, I know) which directly lead to overblown budgets. Source? Insomniac leaks.\n\n\"Recently, some files in the leak revealed that Sony pressured\u00a0[Insomniac Games](https://gamerant.com/tag/insomniac-games/)\u00a0to make budget cuts.\u00a0[According to IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-pressured-its-studios-to-make-big-cuts-amid-increasing-development-costs), Sony requested the company to remove around 50 to 75 people from the studio and recommended the teams from the upcoming\u00a0*Wolverine*\u00a0and\u00a0*Spider-Man 3*\u00a0be cut and replaced with members from\u00a0*Ratchet and Clank*. Part of the reason for these layoffs was Sony\u2019s worry about the growth of development costs at the studio. Sony was concerned that\u00a0*Spider-Man 2*\u00a0cost around $30 million more than its original budget, which was already $270 million\"\n\nI never said that they targeted specific people who worked on Spider-Man 2. I just said that it is insane that studio that released 3 games in 4 years (Miles Morales, Rift Apart, Spider-Man 2) was pressured to lay off it's staff.\n\nSo pretending like there is not problem with rising development costs in AAA industry is just pure naivity.\n\nOne way publisher/developers are trying to combat this is to have smaller core teams in expensive countries (USA - mainly California and Seattle) and outsourcing development to cheaper countries. Or opening new studios/offices in those cheaper countries. Like Activision opened a new studio in Poland and Larian opened a new office in Poland.",

But industry where you need to sell 7,2 million copies at full price just to break even is pretty broken in my view. Because yes, it's Spider-Man. But will Wolverine sell similarly? With same budget? Will next Sony Santa Monica game sell as much copies as God of War Ragnarok? The Last of Us: Part 2 only sold half of what original game sold. Does it mean that Naughty Dog is screwed?\n\nFact that Sony laid off staff at Insomniac even after monster success of SM2 si pretty telling. They know that budgets are becoming a problem.",

The issue here is Spiderman was never going to fail, it's a fairly average game that sold gangbusters largely because of the brand attached. The problem is that with dev costs ballooning like they are, there is more and more pressure for every single large project to be a smash hit that brings back it's investment within a year, because if you have a $300M bust, your company is suddenly in a ton of hot water.\n\nThe risk is outpacing the reward extremely quickly in the AAA gaming industry. More devs than just Sony have spoken up about it.\n\nEdit: I didn't realize the word \"average\" was now an insult/snide remark.

The main point being argued here is one regarding the costs of AAA games across the industry, and as I mentioned, Spiderman is considerably less risky than most games are. You have to really fuck up Spiderman for it to not be a financial success, so of course Sony is going to be far less likely to balk at the price tag. \n\nAnd so again, the point isn't that Spiderman costed too much to make, it's that *all games* are costing too much to make, to the point that anything that isn't a \"sure thing\" is eventually going to get pushed out of the space since they are such risky ventures.

You have no one to blame for that but yourself.\n\nYeah you're reading too far into the word \"average\" in my comment. It's not a \"dig\" and changes absolutely nothing about the conversation we're having. You're putting weight into that because for some reason, it upsets you that some people think the game was average. Has nothing to do with the topic at hand, which is dev costs.\n\nTry not respond so emotionally next time.",

It will still cost $70 for the base game. Because there would be outrage if it was $100. \nSo rockstar has other plans to make up the shortfall - including stuff like selling the game as new 3x on 3 different platforms (the ps3/ps4/PC triple up with GTA5.\n\nThese companies get creative these days. \n\nBut there are tons of expensive games that can last 10-20 hrs (like capcom games) and others that cost similar to develop and are full price titles that offer 100-200hrs of gameplay (Elden ring, persona, ect). So should gamers pay more for longer games or more for games that cost more money to develop but are shorter? There\u2019s no way of really gauging that.\n\nSo like I said - unless some massive changes come to the industry - gaming prices have to stay relatively affordable for base game values.

That's not always true.\n\nI mean, take Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, and Starfield, for instance. These games have graphical fidelity reminiscent of the style and quality of the early to mid PS4 era, yet they took 5, 6, and over 7 years to develop, respectively. Comparatively, God of War: Ragnarok and Horizon: Forbidden West each took 4 years, while Spider-Man 2 took 5.\n\n[According to the Insomniac leaks](https://i.imgur.com/6KliGOi.jpeg), if the studio eliminated its entire in-house animation budget for Spider-Man 2, it would save them 14% of the total costs, or $34.8 million; this is less than the overall cost of the art team, and still doesn't address the issue of people finding the gameplay too repetitive and uninspired. Studios will likely redirect the resources scrapped from cutting animation and art talent into hiring more game designers and programmers. The reality is that making AAA games just takes really fucking long to make and costs a fortune, regardless.",

If these games already cost 200-300 million, trading graphical evolution for innovative design risks won't make them cheaper.

A game half as visually impressive to look at, doesn't necessarily cost and take half as much to make. The argument isn't that the process of reducing costs is as simple as adjusting the ratio of programmers to artists. The argument is that simply cutting costs on animation and art isn't an exit strategy from 200 - 300 million dollar games.\n\nElden Ring likely costs less than that, sure, but the original point is that intense graphical evolution impacts a negative ROI; I tend to think you're overestimating the extent of that. $34.8 million on animation isn't that far off from Insomniac's [$35.0 million marketing spend](https://i.imgur.com/lR9nbTH.png). Arguing that graphics is the sole culprit for ballooning budgets is like arguing that their marketing budget alone should have crippled their returns.\n\n>I take issue with the use of \"visuals\": visuals is a combination of graphics + art direction: you can do less with more and you can explore plenty of ways of making visually appealing games without the latest RTXs and shit.\n\nThey could, but why would we want them to, is the point. The most often repeated reasons on this are a) They take too long to make.  b) They cost too much, and that's not sustainable. c) They should divert their efforts away from graphics to better gameplay; reducing graphics substantially solves none of these presumed issues.\n\nIn reality, gamers want less emphasis on pretty graphics and more focus on engaging gameplay as a better value proposition for their time and money. If the result isn't that, arguing that studios should do less with more without benefiting the consumer in return is encouraging the studios to make a $35.0 million profit with nothing in exchange. I don't really see how that argument is useful.",

I would to just note one thing: basing your analysis on spreadsheet man-hours has a non irrelevant flaw: graphical evolution (a wide net term I purposefully used) has a compounding effect: suddenly, you have to update the engine, integrate a new physics middleware or doing X amount of things on the programming side (which are expensive). Graphical evolution doesn't mean just bespoke/adhoc animation capture or throwaway texture, it means also having to update both tech stack and tech pipelines, it means that every peak of upgrade you do has to uplift also physics, sound... you cannot have one peak aspect of graphics and ignore the rest, it all has to match. Back to Elden Ring: From Software has been very thrifty with their tech upgrades and it shows in their games: Elden Ring wouldn't have been done at that scale and scope if From didn't purposefully keep a tight and constant tech stack that allowed them to keep almost every bit they had since Demon Souls.\n\n>\u00a0c) They should divert their efforts away from graphics to better gameplay; reducing graphics substantially solves none of these presumed issues.\n\nI have an example on this one: Massive Ent. had to downgrade the division 2 Dark Zone from a big 24 player area to small 12 players areas allegedly because fitting high poly char models was too much for the 8th gen. I would also argue that the \"melee combat locked in animation jail\" feeling you get from, say, Spiderman or Batman Arkham is a result of that, compared to more free form combats like Elden Ring or DMCs. Would HiFi-Rush exist if you had to fit the music aspect in awkwardly forced animations on a next gen RTX's model? I'm pretty sure Cyberpunk 2077 would have twice the quests it had if they didn't force themselves in the corner of having free form dialogues instead of relying on the shot-reverse shot dialogue way of Witcher 3, which yeah is limited but much more efficient to choreograph.\n\n>The argument is that simply cutting costs on animation and art isn't an exit strategy from 200 - 300 million dollar games.\n\nAll said and done, I don't disagree with this point, we disagree on how much budget graphics takes but at the end of the day you are still gonna pay 200+ people 13k/month average for 5 years, that's 156 millions right there, no marketing e no contractors: there are floors under which you cannot go.... I dont have a solution for that, the only thing I can say is that players don't need to see Geralt growing a beard in real time or the animation to caress the horse's testicles in RDR2, I'd say that the market is still able to support expansive games like bg3, ER, TotK with ps4 level graphics and we have... 5 years? before they increase the prices by another tenner",

Liz England gives a great breakdown in [\"The Door Problem\"](https://lizengland.com/blog/2014/04/the-door-problem/).\n\n* Creative Director: \u201cYes, we definitely need doors in this game.\u201d\n* Project Manager: \u201cI\u2019ll put time on the schedule for people to make doors.\u201d\n* Designer: \u201cI wrote a doc explaining what we need doors to do.\u201d\n* Concept Artist: \u201cI made some gorgeous paintings of doors.\u201d\n* Art Director: \u201cThis third painting is exactly the style of doors we need.\u201d\n* Environment Artist: \u201cI took this painting of a door and made it into an object in the game.\u201d\n* Animator: \u201cI made the door open and close.\u201d\n* Sound Designer: \u201cI made the sounds the door creates when it opens and closes.\u201d\n* Audio Engineer: \u201cThe sound of the door opening and closing will change based on where the player is and what direction they are facing.\u201d\n* Player: \u201cI totally didn\u2019t even notice a door there.\u201d\n\nThe nature of game development is that complexity grows exponentially, in general. Adding any new feature means the team has to establish and optimize an entirely new pipeline, which significantly increases complexity, regardless of how visually impressive the game is.\n\nSome features take more time to develop, so studios hire more people to expedite the process, but Spider-Man 2 and Elden Ring will take the same amount of time to get to the finish line; the former simply needs a lot more developers to do it.\n\n>Would HiFi-Rush exist if you had to fit the music aspect in awkwardly forced animations on a next gen RTX's model?\n\nI feel like that's a different topic altogether, because Tango Gameworks wouldn't get the budget to do that in the first place. \u00a0Only a handful of studios in the industry have both the willingness and financial capability to create these incredibly expensive games. I'd rather see Rockstar take a massive swing and potentially miss, than use their unique profits to make a worse looking game that most other developers could make.\n\n>I dont have a solution for that, the only thing I can say is that players don't need to see Geralt growing a beard in real time or the animation to caress the horse's testicles in RDR2, I'd say that the market is still able to support expansive games like bg3, ER, TotK with ps4 level graphics and we have... 5 years?\u00a0\n\nThe financial and time investment of adding minute details is a negligible fraction of the overall cost of \"graphics\" compared to producing a single-take cinematic for example. Regardless of the game's technical complexity, developers are still being paid within the expected margin for their work. As a player, you're not really gaining anything in the gameplay experience by not having these features implemented, and as a developer, that's not what you have to exclude to save on time and financial costs.",

The argument being made is that the better value proposition for gamers is to redirect the costs spent on prettier graphics into creating more interesting gameplay, and  graphics cost too much.\n\nMy point is that even if the studio magically cut $35 million and $37.9 million from their overall costs to animation and art respectively, it isn't doing much to get them out of the 200-300 million ballpark, especially when the point of the argument is to get these studios to put those funds into better gameplay and design.",

I'm not sure if that's true in Insomniac's case but in general it should be kept low, and hopefully AI can help reduce costs without lowering quality too much. UI is a relatively small line item here, but it still seems weirdly large at almost 5M compared to 18M for gameplay. \n\nIn terms of overall costs, a lot of the budget goes to ancillary support staff that could also be scaled down somewhat proportionally to the reduced headcount of the direct devs. Less money spent on art and design either means that can be redirected to gameplay, or else cut entirely. If it's cut entirely, it can also lead to reductions in IT, project managers, department heads, admin, HR reps, and the other/ODC costs.",

I'm not disputing that games take longer to make because of their graphics or whatever. The argument is that a game that's half as visually impressive doesn't necessarily take half the time or cost to make. Elden Ring objectively cost more and took longer to develop than Demon's Souls; I don't think anyone is suggesting that having worse graphics and a smaller game was the solution here.",

Then do it again with The Irishman. Then Mean Streets. Even within the general oeuvre of \"Scorsese mob movies\" there's massive diversity in broad appeal. (me personally, I like two of the three: I think Mean Streets needed another pass in editing)",

Used to be you could count on Sony to pump out a really diverse line of exclusives covering every genre under the sun, multiple times a year. Nowadays you have dev times bloated all to hell because they're chasing graphics, and the actual game at the center isn't gonna impress if it's more or less the same as the last several.\n\nThis wasn't really a problem I noticed with the PS4 because the clip they were pumping these games at and the consistency of quality didn't really leave much time or reason to complain, even if they were less diverse than previous generations. But with with PS5 the gaps are so long and just don't feel worth it for what we're getting.\n\nEdit: sort of lost the point while rambling, but the reason people are pointing to indie games is in part because of the stories they're telling, sure, but also because they don't seem to be constrained to \"blockbuster action game with high budget cutscenes\" in the way the AAA market is.",

Which is fine, but frankly isn't very much my jam; they often look nice visually and in cinematics, but I prefer a game to hold my hand less.\n\nLike i'm playing Ghost of Sushi right now and the game is handled in such a way that anyone can play and have the game look sorta cool in some capacity, they accomplish this in some way by redirecting control from the player.\n\nSo the game looks similar to Sekiro in a way, its just the player has less input so while it looks cool, it doesn't *feel* as cool as when you do the same thing Sekiro for example.\n\nAlso I noticed while the game is visually detailed, its not very mechanically detailed. I've started just swinging at doors to open them rather than sitting through the little door opening animation since peasants don't really mind you destroying their nice doors.",

We started 2 years ago with the models giving humans extra fingers and limbs and wonky/impossible movements that were right in the depths of the uncanny valley. Modern models have fixed a lot of those problems, and while, again, it's not perfect and still usually recognizable as AI generated, it's simply a matter of time. I absolutely believe that in 10 years we would get to the point where these models are more than usable for such things, especially if theres someone overseeing the output and tweaking things.",

Any cool idea you could have with this setting, played straight or as a twist, you could simply do and don't bother to try and make it fit somewhere - let the engine figure it out based on all the variables, attributes, traits, personality and relationships of the NPC. \n\nIf you've raised you're affinity with Linda the shopkeeper and she has an employee, well the game can go \"Employer asks MC to investigate Employee\" route. But if you've never talked with Linda the shopkeeper and instead are a big fan of Carmel the mechanic, then maybe that's who's gonna get assigned this quest from the cloud, and since he has a spouse who already frequents the gambling parlor then here we go. This way cool settings can be re-used if the second time would have enough variation to basically make it a whole different quests, and also less chance to miss a really cool quest design idea just because you missed the specific character it's been written for. \n\nWhat the AI would do is help put this together, especially in terms of replacing variable terms in voice acting and animation. \n\nI wouldn't do that to that extent with main quests, but I'd certainly welcome it in, lets say a game like Bethesda's where you could hire and raise affinity with any NPC as companions. A little bit like what Watch Dog: Legion did with the procedurally generated characters, but specifically for basic NPCs instead of characters you play as.",

Tell me what makes Bully better than a Sony game, it has open world and missions and cutscenes. Literal same Rockstar formula. Which actually isn't different from Ubisoft formula, Witcher formula, Cyberpunk formula etc that's just how open world games are. Bully's cutscenes being shorter makes it automatically better despite having a much more primitive gameplay i guess.\n\nJust having more cutscenes you can skip doesn't take away from the gameplay if the gameplay is also great, which is the case with Sony games, removing cutscenes don't make games better. Sony games are popular specifically cause they make all those areas great, otherwise other AAA games exist.",

Like a game shouldn't possibly feel like a movie at any moment even if it has a much superior gameplay. If good gameplay should be the focus, Sony games have that in spades, so bringing up Bully as a better example is weird, must be nostalgia cause its gameplay isn't a good example at all. It also has cutscenes, the only difference is it's more primitive due to **hardware limitations**, so of course they didn't have longer cutscenes. A remake of the game would look like a movie too. So would it be less of a game if it looked realistic with realistic cutscenes? That's ridiculous. That's why i can't buy any of what you are saying as anything more than nostalgia of good old games. PS2 God of War games might also look more like games due to looking primitive and shorter cutscenes, but they were really photorealistic for their time and you can still pull crazy combos in the new games.\n\nPsychonauts might be a great game but platformer genre is just a different genre, if you play too much of the genre you can also get sick of it. It doesn't inherently have more of a game in it than Sony games.",

It\u2019s the same as people wishing Marvel would try new things. Something can be good and over saturated at the same time. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t play them last gen, they may feel new.

Spider-Man 2 and Ghost of Tsushima are different flavors of the same game that Sony and Ubisoft have made for over a decade (Horizon, Assassins Creed, Far Cry, Days Gone, etc etc). The critic Yahtzee formerly of The Escapist derogatorily refers to them as \"Jimminy Cockthroat\" games due to their sameyness as a genre. They cram in as much of the mainstay systems as possible - levelling that isn't actually like an RPG because you just get everything eventually rather than making a 'build', shoehorned crafting elements to everything, half-baked stealth elements, etc. These games are like buffets - everything you can eat, all the content you could want, but none of it is special, or memorable, or stands out against everything as a whole. For me personally it's gotten so absurd that replaying the original 08 Assassins Creed felt like a gritty deconstruction rather than the very first work in the series.\n\nGod of War 2 and Last of Us 2 have issues of their own (for one they are way too long, Sony Santa Monica has been upfront that the GoW reboot was a planned trilogy condensed to 2 games due to long dev times) but largely avoid the pitfalls of being a paint-by-numbers open world cinematic survival craft-em-up video game. And just to clarify, I've actually beaten every single game I discussed in this comment (except modern Assassins Creeds which I tend to DNF due to the absurd amount of bland content). I enjoy games like these from time to time. But they're comfort food, they're not innovative or the best at anything they do. It's like making a really good pot of spaghetti compared to going to a Michelin star restaurant, or a Fast and Furious or Marvel movie compared to whatever artsy movie you want to name here.",

For some reason Zelda having a huge open world and very simple gameplay isn't similar to Ubisoft though. AAA games are blockbuster experiences, of course they aren't like indies. Even if a lot of AAA games have more features than needed, it doesn't necessarily bring down the main gameplay loop. Comparing it to Marvel is also wrong, cause going by that logic, indie action games would be like pixel art version of Marvel movies then.

Answer : >!fucking all of the big releases!<  \nAnd as you mentioned, this hodgepodge of genres makes none of the elements stand out.  \nOpen-world? Minecraft is a true open world. Breath of the Wild and Elden Ring are good open worlds. The average open world approach is literally gating off areas from the player until the plot opens them up or artificially restricting the player via levels.  \nAction-adventure? That's used for every bloody 3rd person-camera game under the sun. Wind Waker was an adventure, DMC5 is an action game, Assassin's Creed has elements of action and adventure, but since they try to both have their cake and eat it, those elements fall short.  \nSurvival and crafting? Surface level systems (that get used better in harder difficulties, but the majority of players will never touch those) that add in more tedium and repetition than needed. Those work in survival and crafting games, and the combination of both, because those are the meat and potatoes that get fully developed, not tacked on because \"every game does it\"\n\nIt's just the same games with a different coat of paint, yet they all sell, so they must do something right. But then again, I've been buying the same strategy game, but with a different coat of paint for a long time (Fire Emblem), so what the fuck do I know",

I mean games with very little story and that are purely focused on being a game. These do still exist, especially in the indie space, and Nintendo is of course fantastic for it, but there's not as much output of games that take this approach anymore from larger studios.\n\nDOOM 2016 is a great example. You're into combat within seconds, it has a \"story\" thats super light, and in general its focused on just being pure fun. There's also other boomer shooters like ULTRAKILL which are fantastic but you know, call me simple, I like the presentation that comes with an upped budget. And I say that as someone who in practice mostly plays games released 20+ years ago.",

In this case, Sony would be able to feed it with all of their assets with regards to video games. Though admittedly I agree with you with the voices of actors, that is tricky. With the art, I imagine the AI would be a tool that the artists themselves use to expand their own capabilities, but with regards to the actors, there would have to be contracts/agreements to train their performances in an AI and that's up to the actors, but that discussion is a whole other can of worms with regards to companies attempting to take their likeness/performances \"in perpetuity\" and what not. \n\nI'm hopeful for the future but still very skeptical that companies will go with the ethical move first before any pressure is put on them to take the ethical route.",

That doesn't single-handedly lift the combat above TLOU2, which is straight up one of the best stealth action games of all time. Calling it a move game is ridiculous and shows you haven't played it.\n\nAlso, most Yakuza games have longer cutscenes and bigger exposition dumps than any Sony AAA title.

Spiderman is extremely basic where the animations look fancy and it's fun to play but it doesn't really do anything special. Likewise R&C is another one of those series that's fun to play but is it that extremely special in gameplay? Not really. Its evolution for gameplay pretty much began and ended with including strafe in R&C2, lol. I love PS2 R&C but it's still basically hopping around on basic platforms and blasting the screen with wacky weapons.",

You explained that all the games I\u2019ve listed are good, not \u201cspecial\u201d which I think God of War pre-reboot falls exactly into that category. \n\nI responded to another comment in the same chain with my favourite 3rd person (melee) action games: DMC3-5, God Hand, KH2 and MGR:R. All of these do their combat systems great justice and make it insanely fun to play to boot with some caveats like DMC4's cut Dante campaign. \n\nI never really thought the gameplay in GoW amazing but it had spectacle to it without ever going too cinematic (with literal cinematics in-fights to pause the gameplay). GoW 2018 in comparison was the polar opposite to me, not only was the enemy variety absolutely non-existent, the combat itself felt absolutely sluggish (and the gear system was bad addition altogether) and there were basically 2 fights in the whole game that I thought to have invoked at least some of the spirit of the old games: Hraezlyr and Baldur. It's a mass appeal game which is why it no doubt garners more fame, but overall I just don't think the combat is even remotely within the best of the genre as one plays more games.",

            "body": "Graphical fidelity was only ever a factor during the earlier days of gaming. Once PS4/Xbone came out we basically peaked. Graphics don't really LOOK any different from then. Like Red Dead 2, God of War... etc. etc. they all look amazing even by todays standards... and they were made for less powerful hardware.\n\nThere's not much juice left to squeeze out of that orange. I think when everybody started going insane over Ray-Tracing was the clue that graphics were going to just look like they do and all we can do is adjust things like lighting now. Smaller more detailed graphical adjustments to try and reach just a liiiiiittle further into the cookie jar for some crumbs.\n\nIt's gotten to a point where the only things people really want anymore from games is higher framerates, and resolutions... and honestly 1440p, and 60fps are basically the perfection point. The higher framerates go, the less you start to notice, same with resolutions.\n\nIt's become this weird balancing act where games even on consoles now have to ship with graphical options! Which is very crazy to me lol! (I don't mind options...)\n\nThat said it's only become more and more apparent with the broadening communities online, and gaming becoming a more widely accepted hobby that all that really matters is cohesiveness. Products need to be cohesive. As long as your art-style, performance, presentation, gameplay etc. are all good and serviceable to eachother it doesn't matter.\n\nI've been playing Paper Mario today and the graphical and audio updates are awesome... but they had to shift it down to 30fps... which is fine. Game plays great, feels great. It's an RPG after all - and the timing on the inputs is buffered so its easy to adjust to.\n\nI think that's why Nintendo always gets such high scores across the board... they just make a cohesive game. Every choice makes sense, and it's all in service of the game as a whole. All the parts working together seamlessly. What you get ends up being a perfectly balanced sandwich. It's not trying to outdo itself in different ways during the games runtime.\n\nIf something like Animal Well can sit amongst Elden Ring, and Baldur's Gate 3... I think that says a lot about what makes a game good, and loved. Timeless even.\n\nThe discourse around games blows my mind when we established that games as a medium exist as more than just the parts they're made up of. My favorite game of all time is Shadow of the Colossus because it's a cohesive, strong experience that doesn't set out to prove itself with any ONE of it's aspects. It's just works together to provide a singular experience.\n\nSo I think as long game devs get to create art, and focus less on trying to wow everyone with the latest graphics... which has already been done (Uncharted 4 is THE video game movie...) I'll be happy.\n\nSpend less, focus on making good... unique games.",
