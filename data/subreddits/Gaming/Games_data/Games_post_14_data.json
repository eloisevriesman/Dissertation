Everything we've seen about this game is very far off, if the leaks we did see are anything to go off, they're far more likely to talk about the Venom game out next year according to the leaked schedule. \n\nThis just kinda feels like an empty post, \"no news\" is I guess news, but not much to talk about.",

So stuff like Ultimate Alliance or Marvel vs Capcom can still feature X-Men characters\n\nAnother notable exception is that Deadpool is not listed among the characters that PlayStation have permission to use as part of these future X-Men titles",

Its why Kamela Khan was an Inhuman (though now they've hilariously retconned that either she's a mutant or both), and why in the shows they were setting up stories that were carbon copy mutant stories just as \"inhumans\" instead. \n\nFunnily enough, since 2019, Inhumans have basically vanished from the comics. I think Black Bolt has had less than 5 appearences since 2019, and he's one of the most important characters in the Marvel world.\n\nBasically, I dont know if Marvel or the developers were confident that having JUST Xmen characters would be enough when they've only recently been regaining popularity.",

The narrative, stories and conflicts are designed around villain-hero relationships in power level. This means that games with these characters diverge from the pathways in narrative that define their interaction in the world.\n\nPretty sure someone could write a thesis about this on the topic of ludonarrative dissonance.  \n\nSpiderman and Tony stark are the two I can think off that progress via technology.

Mine is one of logarithmic growth over the narrative growth of wolverine who gets a metal skeleton. Of the physical aging of superman who comes more fully into his powers over time. Or thor getting a new hammer and blessing. Batman is a good example of technological and physical progression in skill but he is fundamentally limited by the capacity of human growth.\n\nDragonball is a good example of the progression that can exist when it is foundational to the ruleset of the world. Even better, consider Naruto: the entire premise of the show is about gaining strength and progressing in skills. Progression is built into the world and its characters. Marvel and DC heroes exist in a flat world where progression is not the premise of society at all. Training is undertake to use held power but it is certainly not to gain new powers.",
