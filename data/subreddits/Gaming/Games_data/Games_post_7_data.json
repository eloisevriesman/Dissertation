            "body": "I played the game (Alone in the Dark) at release. I paid full price. I don't think it's a bad game per se, but if you compare it to titles like the Resident Evil remakes, it just isn't that good. It's not as fluid and it's very clear it has a lower budget. If you go into it knowing that, you'll probably have a good time (like I did).",

Resident Evil is a huge outlier in the genre in terms of sales, and it remains to be seen if even the second biggest pillar of it (Silent Hill) can make a significant comeback with their upcoming titles. Personally, I have my doubts.\n\nIt seems to me that we're in a situation where for the foreseeable future the genre will be RE, smaller efforts from indie teams like Signalis and that's about it unless someone can somehow strike absolute gold with a new title at the precise right time.",

                            "body": "The problem is that there's so much money at the top end of gaming that people expected every title to have massive marketing campaigns that consist of high budget trailers at every major event, gaming or otherwise, a massive ad presence on websites, tie-ins with other games, and a dozen other marketing tactics I'm missing.\n\nThe problem is that all of that is ludicrously expensive, so mid and low budget titles rely on the very bare minimum.\n\nAs an example, look at the recently released Hellblade II; Hellblade II has had trailers at every Xbox event since it's announcement (as far as I'm aware) as well as a presence on the Xbox dashboard for the past few weeks, alongside a miriad of other marketing tools such as pre roll ads on YouTube and other social media sites, yet every conversation about it on Reddit was dominated by people stating it was not being marketed enough. Not to say that Hellblade is a mid-budget title, by the way, I'm just using it as an example.\n\nIn this very thread you'll see people who state they engage with gaming media frequently, yet they either didn't know the Alone in the Dark reboot had been released, if they even knew about it at all.\n\nIt's a really fascinating little thing to look at because it makes you question how we should be marketing these titles.",

Annapurna and Devolver sorta have that, but they also have realistic sales goals. I assume they do decent market research since they haven't done a series of layoffs after layoffs, so their stuff sells, is priced decently, marketed well, etc. Like, it makes absolutely no sense to me that Embracer expected this game to do super well. Alone in the Dark has been dormant for over a decade, and the game looked decent, at best. Why did they put so much money behind it? Why did they sell it for $60?

I can look past the rough janky gameplay and the lower budget, as I did enjoy the story and cutscenes... but I had the game tank its frame rate several times, had the game full on crashed on me (sometimes at specific cutscenes that were actually significant to the story), and ran into a bug that forced me to replay two hours of the game.\n\nAnd you know what about that last part? Apparently, that wasn't the worst bug. There was actually two other bugs that were way worse. Both of them were probably fixed by now, but for at least a month, these two bugs were present. One of them softlocked you by requiring you to use a set of keys that you get in Chapter 1 to use in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2... only for some reason the keys were coded to be used only three times total instead of one time at three different doors, meaning if you used the key on the same door in Chapter 1 (because it glitched and locks itself), then when you get to Chapter 2, you can't use the key twice, and the only option at the time was to restart the whole game if you didn't have a backup save.\n\nThe other? Way worse. In the beginning of Chapter 4 of 5, which is around 6-8 hours into the game (and damn near the end since Chapter 5 is about 20 minutes), you're meant to be locked on rails and can only go through a very specific door to trigger a cutscene. Well, what happens when that door is glitched and is also locked? For a month after launch, there was literally nothing you could do. Even the guy who had it happen to them posted a video of them restarting a save from the end of Chapter 3 and playing it again, and it still didn't fix it. At the time I was at the Discord, it wasn't fixed, and I haven't bothered to check if it has.\n\nLike, I honestly thought me replaying two hours of Chapter 4 was bad, but at least it fixed the game and I was able to finish it. \n\nAlso, for a game that was $60, it was lacking in content. Sure, horror games were short, and there's two campaigns, but the only difference is literally cutscenes, one singular gun, some collectibles (not even all, just some), and one specific flashback section of the game. That's it. What's worse? No unlockables. No skins, no filters, no developer commentary... unless you pay for it. Yes, you can't get anything like the classic 3DO skins, the horror filters, and the ability to hear what the developers were thinking when they were working on the game unless you pay for it. Even RE2 Remake threw you a bone with the classic costumes, unlockable weapons, and 4th Survivor/ Tofu Survivor with multiple Tofus to play as.",

Everyone is all \"The marketing sucks, this could have ridden the current survival-horror wave\" but it's like, hardly anyone cares about Alone in the Dark. Even when it was bigger, it quickly got overshadowed by other survival horror series like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. Easy enough to go and read about on Wikipedia. By the time the second game was ported to consoles in 1996, it was already being compared unfavorably to Resident Evil. Even the reviews for most games in the series aren't particularly stellar. Remakes like this make me scratch my head and assume that they're primarily made because some higher ups with a fondness for the original series forced it into existence. \n\nA lot of the current survival horror popularity seems to come from younger gamers too, like people in their teens and 20s, Gen Z kids who played a lot of Five Nights at Freddy's growing up and watched horror reaction youtubers. I'm not gonna pretend I'm super hip or anything like that, but I just can't see that audience getting excited about a remake of a horror game from the early 90s that's also set in the 1930s. Something about it just doesn't feel like it has a very large appeal.",

Shit like \u201chmm wish it was $30 instead\u201d - how about we make video games free, only those costing bazillion bucks can earn a price tag?! \n\nNobody expects Alone in the Dark to sell as many copies as a remake of the most acclaimed Resident Evil game. There\u2019s no fucking way they\u2019d come even close to selling half of that. But Alone in the dark also costs money to make and they somehow have to make it back. Therefore no, they can\u2019t sell it for fucking 20 or 30 whatever dollars.\n\nAlso, the game is really good and people who like horror games should play it. But I bet those people finished it already and sadly, it\u2019s not going to appeal to Spider-Man and Nu-Resi fans, because it simply isn\u2019t a blockbuster.",

Cartoons and CGI exist for both forms of media, making the exact same things possible. What kind of characters are only able to made within games? Pixel characters?\n\n>They are absolutely unnecessary and break the immersion and are there to stroke the egos of the developers.\n\nDo voice actors do the same thing to you then? They are much the same real people, some which might be personally chosen by the directors for their roles - perhaps even speaking quite blatantly in their normal tone. Does it not break immersion, for instance, to have Mark Hamill voice act? Is Mark Hamill allowed to voice act only within the space of cartoons and not in video games?

It's an entirely different subject matter. Generally voice acting is less intrusive even if the actor is using their normal voice because most people don't recognize voice actors' voices the same way they recognize even a semi-famous actors face. I doubt most people see Nolan North's face every time Drake talks. But if Drake had North's face, it could be off-putting, especially after years of being in the spotlight of being the generic male 01 voice. And talented voice actors can change their voice when creating the character.\n\nBut Mark Hamill will always look like Mark Hamill if his face is in Star Citizen's Squadron 42. And it is miles more immersion-breaking. Because it's no longer the character in the universe of Star Citizen, it's Mark Hamill acting as the character in the Star Citizen universe. And to me it is a detriment. And it becomes even more so if the actor is someone I'm not terribly fond of.\n\nAnd with video games we have the tools to avoid these situations, truly create memorable characters but instead we just push forward towards some sort of cinematic legitimacy, as if the industry ever needed to be held to the same \"lofty\" standards like the movie industry.",
