                    "body": "I also gave up on it. But it's a very different game than Hollow Knight. \n\nHere are the things I don't like about Dave the Diver:\n\n1) It's tedious. I know some people like games with tons of different things to do. To me, it feels like a second life. I don't want to manage 1,000 things. I already have my real life for that. I'm playing a game to get away from that. Why they thought it was a good idea to include so many mechanics is beyond me. It's trying to do way too much.\n\n2) The sandbox aspect of the game is pretty weak. The ocean world isn't that randomized. It's more or less the same underwater map every time and there's not much to get excited about in terms of what you find. At first it seems really cool and open-ended and then you realize there's nothing rare to find and the things that are rare are basically in set locations.\n\n3) The game is way too prescriptive in when you're allowed to do things. For a game that seemingly allows you to explore, it's fairly linear. Events happen according to a preset timetable, not when you make a discovery. When a new thing does happen, there's a cutscene and a bunch of dialogue and it's suddenly more like a JRPG than an open-world adventure game. The game has an unending string of procedurally generated fetch quests, if you want them - not my idea of a good time. \n\nI get why some people love the game. It has some charm. It does a few things well, but it wasn't the gameplay I wanted. I was hoping for Terraria meets Pokemon in the ocean, and it's not that. It's more like 15 games crammed into one. For people who love RPGs, I imagine all of this is a lot more palatable, but for players like me who value pure gameplay and freedom above most other things, the game disappoints a bit.",
