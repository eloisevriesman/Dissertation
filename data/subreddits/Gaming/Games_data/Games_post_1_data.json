In regards to the actual game itself though, I'm just really happy I was able to get a team together to build something we are deeply passionate about. And having led with that in mind, I've learnt that that is truly the way to create something you can be proud of - by building it from a place of love and passion.\n2. >!Kalunga, the God of Death was always real in Zau's world. In my eyes, Zau was conversing with Death - his take on what Death is - which was his Baba. The image of Death for Zau, at that moment, was his Baba. And I think that was the realisation that Zuberi had that allowed him to complete his Baba's story!<",

My question to you is something I\u2019m sure many developers have to deal with but is there something that you regret cutting from the game because you guys ran out of time or that it just didn\u2019t make sense anymore with the current iteration of the game? Another question is what are you proudest of in the game? I\u2019m truly curious about your process.",

For example, we didn't have time to implement a true fog of war system because we had other elements (combat, enemy AI, etc.) that would  give the player a better experience overall. There was a few of those, hah! \n\nOne element that did get cut that didn't make sense was that the player could flip between 4 masks (Maskless counted as a masked state to a degree). When playing it over and over, it didn't make sense so we went down to 2 masks.\n\nI'd say there are many elements I'm proud of with this game, but the biggest one is the Reflection moments - the player simply sitting under a tree and increasing their chances of survival by speaking about how they feel.",

If you can get the ball rolling, you'll find those finer details the deeper you get into it. It's just about giving yourself that small push.

We then implemented it in game, realised some bits didn't make sense, and needed to do an additional week of pick ups. From the actors perspective, you're like \"But it made sense to me!\" but from a Devs perspective, you gotta think about the whole user experience and flow and pacing as a whole!\n\nIt's another puzzle in itself haha!",

It's hard, and dealing with the grief is too real, often visceral. \n\nI wanted you to know that as a fellow game maker, releasing a game, especially one that is so intimate and personal is no small feat. I have no questions. I'd just like to say I hope you and your team are immensely proud of this accomplishment. I know what it's like to put your everything into a work of art, and from one person who has been there to another, I'm proud of you and hope this experience has allowed you to process your grief meaningfully.\n\nCongratulations on releasing Kenzera, it's a beautiful game, and I hope it leads to future opportunities for Surgent Studios to tell more intimate and healing stories.",

Yet within this world it will provide you with the tools in order to maneuver around it. It will always be hostile to you, but over time, you will get more and more comfortable with it. You will never master it though. Sometimes you will feel it working with you, most of the time against you...or neither at all.\n\nThat to me is the journey of grief.",
