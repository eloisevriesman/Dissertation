Having a co-op more is going to be great too, and the Multiplayer in the original game was a lot of fun. So much about the game just looks awesome.\n\nDo slightly feel like i would have prefered the Tyranid invasion be the focus for the whole game though rather than having chaos involved yet again and taking away from that side somewhat. Chaos forces being involved / behind something has become a quite common thing to happen in 40k stories, so it's something that has become a little repetitive and uninspired at this point, really. \n\nVery much looking forward to the game anyway, great that space marine is getting a sequel after so long.",

So much of the violent religiosity is just best explored through Chaos. \n\n\nPlus I think people get a bit bored of fighting monsters at some point, they want to fight other humans (insofar as Chaos marines are still human). I think things like Eldar would also scratch that itch but depicting them in a game like this seems super expensive.  Also kind of a lore LOL moment if the character single handedly kills like 500 Eldar.",

This is particularly of note because Genestealers Cults had roster/lore updates in the somewhat recent past that could have been explored too. It would be very easy to incorporate those sorts of enemies into the game to keep that more \"human\" element available as an enemy.",

We already fought Orks. Dark Eldar are another option. Then the other Xenos factions would feel bad to fight lol. Killing Tau as a Space Marine wouldn't feel... uh... well you wouldn't feel like the good guys.

Killing Tau as a Space Marine wouldn't feel... uh... well you wouldn't feel like the good guys.\n\nThey've fought each other extensively in the Damocles Gulf Crusade, with it ending in a stalemate because the Imperium had to go deal with the Tyranids. I imagine from a gameplay perspective it'd sort of feel like fighting the Automatons in Helldivers 2 and then going off to fight the Terminids. Tau are noted for being really annoying long-range combatants, generally trying to kill you before you can get to close-range combat where they're not as strong.\n\nIn general there's no real lore reasons that would restrict enemy types (but who knows with Games Workshop when it comes to video games and the licensing, they can sometimes get really strict with what is depicted).\n\nDawn of War Dark Crusade/Soulstorm basically had some kind of an excuse for fighting every other faction due to its more open-ended campaign (almost like a 4x campaign map). Even Imperial Guard fighting Space Marines or Space Marines fighting Sisters of Battle.\n\nThis [video](https://youtu.be/4WRFa5PXgGA?si=Ml8xQvqeNVfklTqE&t=3190) shows the post campaign victory text for an Imperial Guard battle against Space marines. Which is consistent with the tabletop because there are no rules saying you can't have Imperium factions fighting each other, and they often do in the lore (without it leading to full blown civil war).",

It would be insane to argue that Drukhari aren't more blatantly evil than Tau or their Craftworld cousins. \"The Imperium is Xenophobic and bad!\".

The whole \"Inquisitors are fucking monsters\" thing looks different when you consider that literally one cultist could open some small tear that would let in a demon that would rapidly spiral to not just killing an entire planet, but damning their souls to perpetual torment. This isn't a universe where being a good person will save you, if you're some factory worker and a demon exerts its will on you or a Nurgle plagues comes through, you're fucked now and forever.\n\n\nAnd you'd probably be pretty xenophibic towards Eldar if on the regular they burnt entire Imperial systems because some prophecy said if they didn't then in 200 years a demon would be born there.",
