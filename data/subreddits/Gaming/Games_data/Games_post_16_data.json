Like, what's the last Star Wars racing game we've had? Lord of the Ring strategy game? These megacorps are schlorping up all these universes and then just occasionally squeezing out one shitty game that doesn't meet expectations, and then Games Workshop is shotgunning weird nonsense all over so that even if it's only good a quarter of the time, that's still plenty of fun games.",
