But gamers get bent out of shape if a game they like gets a bad score.

I *don't* like RTS games at all though, so if I had to review one for IGN or whatnot, I'd give it a bad score regardless of its quality as an RTS game as I just don't like them. My opinion of an RTS game really isn't very interesting, so why include it? I'd argue the only ones I should be reviewing are games like Total Warhammer because they're a combination of 4X and RTS. If you knew my preferences, you'd know I was coming at the review from the angle of someone getting their pickles in my peanut butter and just how palatable I find that. \n\nI've never really paid much mind to game reviews for this reason. I like reading the blurbs in the big review threads because I get a better sense of whether *I'd* like it from those quotes than I'd get from a simple 1-100 score. Those scores are just for dick-measuring. If my favorite game of the year gets a 60 on metacritic, it's no less my favorite game of the year.",

It's so bad unless you have a PC and modify ini files which only partially fixes it and should not be necessary. Seems like he has allowed his excitement about new thIngs to override objective analysis in the last few vids he's made, feels like the least reliable person at DF",

The game is clearly going for an extremely specific aesthetic and mood and the visuals match that pretty well I'd say. Movies and TV add noise and post-processing to the image all the time for aesthetic purposes, why is that not allowed here? Sure, it could be argued those features should be toggles, but there's obviously an artistic vision here and all the post processing is a big part of that.",
