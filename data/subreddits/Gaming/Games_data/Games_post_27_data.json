Sadly this is not a good example that any other game should follow, as it has a huge risk of people leaving the game. Dota 2 is also experiencing this issue, as not everyone is willing to re-learn new stuff (I left after 7.00, came back a few years for a few games and left for good, now I'm just reading a big patch notes), so they are also kind of pushing it a bit too far.

If you didn\u2019t put a point into a skill, whether it was an active or passive ability you just did not have that ability at all. \n\nInnate passives now give a hero a passive skill that they start the game with and don\u2019t need to put points into. They will always have that skill no matter what. \n\nFacets are a choice between 2 modifiers that the player picks after picking your character and before the game actually starts. An example of the one character I\u2019ve played a match with, Drow Ranger, can pick between being able to move and use items while channeling one of her spells (channeling in dota normally requires you to stand still and not do anything else or it fails to cast the spell), or they do more damage when attacking an enemy from a higher elevation. \n\nIt lets you tailor your teams hero picks to better synergize with each other and better counter the opponents. \n\nWhat makes this update crazy is they added these innate passives and facets to all of the 120-ish heroes in the game all at once with no sort of beta test with a new hero that had it or a public test realm.",

Ringmaster trailer dropped half a year ago, Muerta over a year ago, primal beast 2 years, Marci 3 years ago. Now were in the crown fall event 6 months after the character trailer with no release date for ringmaster, not even a roadmap for the event. For all we know crown fall is what we\u2019re getting for the entire summer and by the end all these \u201cacts\u201d will just look like content slop that no one asked for. Like I said I can\u2019t complain too much right now because they\u2019ve been pretty active this past year in other aspects, but one character release every year or longer is an atrocious schedule for a MOBA. All I hope is that once they\u2019re done restructuring Dota in a way they like they focus on characters more again. 2 a year should be the minimum imo",
