In Tekken 8, what many people considered to be one of the the worst characters for a while (Panda, because she's just a worse Kuma) had the best win rate. Likely because the people who actually played her were either highly skilled players who wanted a challenge run up the ladder, or they were longtime bear players that just decided to stick with Panda, while many Kuma players were likely newer at the franchise.\n\nHow prevalent a character is at higher ranks means more (Panda was one of, if not the, lowest represented characters at higher ranks), though can still be misleading. Generally, a bad character won't be as common in higher ranks because their mains can't climb as high, though that can lead to strong characters being slept on or \"easier\" or \"gimmicky\" characters being overrepresented.\n\nTournament results are the best way to judge character strength.",

Then you see the stats showing he dominates in the lower ranks because, well, people that rank don't know how to counter the gimmick. These games are so wildly different throughout the ranked tiers that a general win rate across the board doesn't tell you much.",
