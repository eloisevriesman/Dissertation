Only 1 zombies map (2 with The Giant Pre-order bonus) \n\nOnly 25 primaries. Not the most in the franchise by far. MW19 had 29 on launch. Also BO3\u2018s guns have like 10 attachments max. \n\nCampaign is one of the longest in the series sure, but it\u2019s also bottom 3 campaigns so not really anything to bang at home about. \n\nThe parkour mode never got any updates and was forgotten about. \n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that BO3 has some of the most outrageous monetizations in all of COD, only slightly better than BO4 which is by far the worst monetized. \n\nCall me a Treyarch hater but their games are some of the most overrated games in COD. They haven\u2019t had a game with 3 good modes since 2012\u2018s BO2. And the rumors are they didn\u2019t even make the campaign for BO6. It\u2019s rumored Raven Software (who made the BO:CW campaign too) are behind it. \n\nAt this point Raven just needs their own game. They are constantly brought in to fix the mistakes of the 3 main studios, they clearly have some of the best ideas (BO:CW campaign is sick) and They don\u2019t seem to have really many flaws. Oh and they made some of the best Star Wars games in the 2000s so seeing them as a support studio for these trash ass devs is so sad to see.",

I'd quite like it to focus more on the espionage side of things. I know that's what Black Ops tried to do, but I don't feel like it fully embraced it. \n\nI'd like it if both Modern Warfare and Black Ops actually focused on modern warfare and black ops respectively, rather than trying to mix the two together. One game is about fighting an enemy on the frontlines as a soldier, the other game is about carrying out clandestine operations behind enemy lines as a spy. Then they can release games between them that focus on a specific conflict or era.",

Just look up how long it took to unlock every DLC gun. Were talking Star Wars BF2 level of insanity. One gun after every 750 hours. And that\u2019s if every game is exactly 10 minutes and you win every game. Could easily have been 1000+ hours for one gun. They are just riding off their legacy of BO2 for a decade now.",

And they added a ton of maps over the game's cycle and supported it well. They still have yet to make a subpar CoD from a multiplayer standpoint, so I see no reason to doubt them yet.",

The map for this mode was converted INTO the Blackout map only a few months before release. Images of the mode leaked last year. \n\nAlso BO3 and BO4\u2018s multiplayer are some of the weakest in the franchise. The Overwatch-lite hero shooter bs with free kill streaks was so bad. I don\u2019t play COD for a hero shooter. I want a casual shooter. And CW had the weird cooldown period for killstreaks for no reason. and the pay-to-win guns of BO3 is some of the most fucked up shit. I knew a rich kid in high school who spent $3k and STILL didn\u2019t get all the guns in BO3. That\u2019s how bad that lootbox system was. And when they finally did add the way to earn them. It was one gun after 75 wins. Or about 750 hours (average 10 minute game) just for one gun. \n\nI see plenty of reasons to doubt Treyarch. Their games are tailored to the sweatiest no lifers who want small symmetrical maps, the same exact perks for the last decade, god forbid they change how Ninja works, and be as bland as possible. \n\nPersonally I think Raven should get their own game. They knock it out of the park for whatever gamemode they are forced to come fix. Pretty much all the support studios would be more interesting to get a game from than the 3 main dev teams at this point.",

There\u2019s a few smaller devs who also came back too. \n\nIt\u2019s part of why the vision for the modern IW games changed so drastically from IW(the game) and MW19 after only 3 years. Mark, Joel and the others who came back and were brought into leadership are specifically the ones pushing for the modern realism style of shooter those games are. \n\nIt\u2019s actually the OG devs that the fans specifically should be mad at if they don\u2019t like MW19 or MWII. They came back to the franchise after being away for almost a decade. Of course their vision for the games clash with the current fanbase.",

Not only have they had the most expensive \u201ccollectors\u201c editions. They introduced micro transactions in BO2, B03 introduced \u201cCOD POINTS\u201c and gumballs / zombies monetization, BO4 introduced the battlepass with paid skips while still having the season pass model. \n\nTreyarch games are quite literally the most monetized. Look at DLC guns in BO3 and BO4 and compare that to Infinite Warfare released in between those games. Why does IW have the better monetization where DLC guns were easy to unlock?
