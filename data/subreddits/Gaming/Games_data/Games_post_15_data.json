I just kept using yen cards to make other purchases for those three months as most games aren't region locked so it wasn't that big of a deal.",

This article has nothing to do with Valve. valve isn't the one holding these games up from being published. Its the publisher treating steam differently for their users. Even if valve had anything to do with this, why is deck stock relevant? They should stop everything until they wait for their manufacturer to get more stock in hand? What a ridiculous thought.",
