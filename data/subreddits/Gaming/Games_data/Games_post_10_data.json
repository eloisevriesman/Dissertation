So it doesn't really matter when that game actually launches, it's in their best interests to keep this game running smoothly, because those swathes of people are far less likely to jump ship to Sims 5 just because Sims 4 stops being supported/working. \n\nI can totally see them leaving a small team like this behind to keep updating The Sims 4 with bugfixes and improvements for at least a year or two after 5 is out.",
