That's 150 in such a short amount of time. Reminds me of the Blumhouse method, just fund so many things at once and bank off the ones that actually find an audience, it just ain't panning out here.",

                    "body": "The Blumhouse method works partly because all the projects are really small (read: cheap) and they concentrate on the most profitable genre (horror). They also don't buy up a ton of smaller production companies that are all doing their own shit. If you look at the [list on wikipedia for the acquisitions Embracer made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Embracer_Group#cite_note-29), they bought up dozens, maybe up to a hundred companies. The two biggest being 1.2 Billion$ for Gearbox and 2.75 Billion\u20ac for Asmodee with a bunch of smaller ones between 1-300 Million$. \n\nThe proper Blumhouse version would have been giving 2 or 3 dozen small studios somewhere between 1-10 million each to **publish** a smaller indie game over 1.5-3 years. If they develop great relationships with specific studios maybe scoop them up. But trying to buy 100 studios in 4 years and expecting anything but absolute chaos makes no sense.",
