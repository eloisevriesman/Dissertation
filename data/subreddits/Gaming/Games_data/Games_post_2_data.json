A big problem in the first game is that with the set mission structure every campaign played out the same, and while the combat system was intriguing at first it became really monotonous and you were just going through the same motions every fight. They also mentioned on their discord that making the combat more fast-paced is a priority, which is also great to hear because even easy fights previously would take ages.\n\nAlso the addition of new environments that aren't just some slight variation of \"Green Necron tomb\" is great.",

In the first game your tech priests become incredibly powerful once you familiarize yourself with the mechanics and cognition management, level up a bit, and accrue more equipment. Combat basically turns into a puzzle instead of a threat, figuring out how to eliminate every enemy in a single round. Still a great game and great fun either way, though.",
