                            "body": "About a year and a half ago now, a very popular YouTuber called hbomberguy released a two hour video which was primarily a grand expos\u00e9 of Tommy Tallarico and his frequent lies and exaggerations about his career accomplishments, as someone who works on audio for video games. \n\nSince hbomberguy released a similar and even more widely-viewed and discussed expos\u00e9 about the YouTuber James Somerton, a few months ago, the Tommy Tallerico video has gained even more exposure.\n\nAnd now it's become a whole meme to say that hbomberguy might make a career-ruining video about someone.\n\nTommy Tallerico's greatest claim to fame is now the total destruction of his career and credibility at the hands of a YouTuber previously best known for liking Transformers and Dark Souls II. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/0twDETh6QaI",

With incredibly unfortunate timing, one of the major selling points of the console would be that it had no online play.\n\nTo fund the project, he started multiple million dollar+ crowdfundings, sometimes using incorrect and misleading info on who was still on the team. He even went on record to say that the Karma System they were marketing was just \"some shit \\[they\\] made up\".\n\nI highly recommend checking out the video, because this doesn't even scratch the surface of Tommy's shenanigans.

You pay by the 15 minutes.\n\nI think if all executed correctly, this could be a hit in social centers.\n\nThere are a number of indy arcade-like games that if some front end UI rework was done to handle a public environment they could be candidates.",
