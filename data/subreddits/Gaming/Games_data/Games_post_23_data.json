If it bothers them so much, perhaps they should try shifting to this style of content updates.",

                    "body": "A lot of it can have to do with business requirements and convenience. Axed stuff gets left in because it can often be more work to remove it--and it can potentially break things because things are interconnected in ways you hadn't realized. Easier to just leave it in and code around it--especially with storage space being so cheap.\n\nFor stuff that gets loaded in before it's released, one explanation can be that it's to reduce friction by having only one major content download. That way you can release a small patch that can be donwloaded quickly whenever you want to unlock content, without having to make players regularly wait for potentially large downloads on slow connections.\n\nUltimately it varies studio-to-studio and depends a lot on the architecture of the game, delivery mechanism, and business needs of that particulart developer/publisher.",

I kinda forgot that wasn't said by a game dev (assuming their director is only some fancy suited guy with a briefcase). If that's important, give their team enough time do plan ahead and develop in a way to avoid this kind of stuff. It's not easy, but if it's a problem, it must (and can) be done.",

Sometimes it\u2019s as easy as just scooping it back out, but if it\u2019s a change that causes a lot of refactoring to implement then you essentially have to defactor the code back to its original state which takes time. \n\nI\u2019m not saying I agree with the director, personally I\u2019m of the mindset that if it\u2019s in the game files then it\u2019s fair game. But your mindset of \u201cjust don\u2019t leave anything in there to be mined\u201d is hysterical because it shows how little you understand huge software projects with millions of lines of code.

As I said in another opportunity, it's something to be part of the project since its conception. Of course you can't plan ahead for everything, but this kind of leak, seems really possible. But I also understand them, mostly because it's usually not the devs fault, it's about mismanagement and higher ups pushing the release more than they should.",
