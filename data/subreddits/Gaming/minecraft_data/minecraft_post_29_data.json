Slavery/forced detention/forced deportation/racketeering/human experimentation (imprisoning villagers, taking villagers from homes, villager farms for wheat,iron, etc, forcing villagers to sell lower by turning them to zombies then healing em) -Credit: Wyikii-\n\n30. Assault and battery (beating a villager)\n\n31. Torture (harming a mob or villager to near death then healing them and doing it over again and again)\n\n32. Too much Rizz? -Credit: Training-Bee-8209-\n \n33. Human/sex trafficking (trapping villagers into forced labor or forced sex for babies)\n\nThat\u2019s all the new ones I can think of, and to clear up a few things, 1. I\u2019m charging Steve based off USA law, shoulda clarified that before but I just straight up forgot different countries have different laws 2. Yea technically starting fires ain\u2019t technically illegal in some instances but start a big enough one and it is so interpret how ya wanna, 3. I know technically speaking the redstone one ain\u2019t a crime unless used specifically but I was trying to just expand out with everything I could possibly think of, my b 4. Yea I know I threw a few magic things in their but I honest to god just couldn\u2019t think of anything trying to tie in the nether and end, so I just decided to focus on the overworld, so ima leave it up to y\u2019all to interpret how you want to with how illegal it is for Steve to inavade on literal different worlds xD\n\nLove ya pookie bears <3",
