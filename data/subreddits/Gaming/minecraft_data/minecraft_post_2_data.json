Be careful to not download anything on the console as it will probably delete permanently the files and ask someone who is competent in this regard. Hope this helps.\u00a0\n\n\nI recently deleted (because I'm dumb) corrupted files of a world i spent almost 300 hr\u00a0with my friends and im really sad. I'm waiting for a sony adapter to arrive via Amazon to check in the hard disk if the 900mb of worlds are still there... the waiting is killing me.",

This means around 44.4% of your life and experiences are connected to this world. \n\nEvery aspect of this world mimics a part of your life in that time frame, every build a symbol of your day to day life, every block is a moment of dedication to a project you never knew if someone else would see and appreciate as much as you did. This is the beauty of the world we live in. Everyone has a story they tell in different ways, this time, it was Minecraft. You\u2019ve been able to share a small corner of this story with us. You were able to log on after every hard day of school to just relax and build something new, you were able to hangout with friends and go on new adventures you\u2019d never get to experience on another game or even another world. These experiences will live on as fond memories of your childhood that you will look back to later in life and wonder, \u201cWhere would I be if I still had that world?\u201d\n\nA chapter of your life has gone and ended, but this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s lost. The memories will live on, and you can start anew. You have dedicated a significant portion of your life to this game we call Minecraft, and Minecraft will live on without this world, just as you will. \n\nI sincerely hope to see you get the world recovered, or start a new world with some new friends, and make new experiences and memories with them. For now, I would rest, take some time to yourself and get a fresh mindset. This is a time for you to hold the past close to your heart, and keep your head looking to the future. \n\nI salute you my friend, and hope to see you again soon.",

My entire neighborhood/friends would come over and play on my Minecraft world because I had the best setup. All of my friends which were probably around 20 by the time the world disappeared had played on it and built a house or something or more. Some of my friends played on it and then moved away so that was the worst part. We had a huge City just like the one we lived in, we built all these restaurants and stores just like the ones we had in town. The coolest apartment complexes with little loft apartments. Gigantic ass houses and a little mini ore pyramid. And a really long minecart train that led to the oceanside hotels we made.\n\nI have a really bad memory but it is truly insane how well I remember that world. Like I remember it so clearly, we spent so many hours on it. Anytime I think of Minecraft, I will always remember that world and wish I could get it back. I still play but it's not the same and with all these new updates and since I'm getting older it's hard to catch up. I love it, but man did I love it back then. I am planning on playing tomorrow with a friend. that's just because I got the urge to play hardcore again (that'll probably be for like a week because I'm currently sick). I hope you get it back, I really do.",

Microsoft in general can't be trusted, either. All my save data for every Bethesda game also gets periodically deleted, and those are some of my favorite games. I have about 3 months with any BGS game before it deletes the save for whatever reason. Thats a assuming I can even get into the game, which I can't even say for skyrim after a glitch cause it to duplicate the same prisoner save 300 times or something.\n\nIf I could switch to Playstation I could but I don't trust Sony much more.",

I was scared, confused, yet so excited, made the big braun move (at that time, for myself), i managed to craft not only planks and a crafting table, but even sticks! I thought, smh like \"oh ye, sticks deal more damage then just a bare hand\", or whatever. I dig a hole in the ground, with trapdoors for blocks \"stairs\". And dig a hole beneath them, so that the monsters (mobs) would fall down and i would easily kill them. I was such a smart little guy. Oh and how was my surprise, when the spiders was not aggressive during the day! Later few years - I didn't know /gamemode 0, only knew 1 and 2 when it was added. I thought, \"once i go creative, I won't be able to survive anymore\". Oh, and guys, im still excited to kill the Ender Dragon! I never killed him without cheat codes and/or gamemode 1! And i played, since some old ass version, where was no hunger. The least version i remember - 1.2.5. But believe me, it was only when i thought the version after some updates! I didn't see indef or infdef myseld tho. \nGod, im becoming too emotional",
