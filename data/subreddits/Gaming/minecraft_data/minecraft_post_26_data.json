Get a map from the creative inventory, and \"use\" the map to fill it in.\n\nThe default map size is 128x128 blocks, so it's pretty large. If the first map doesn't show it, then have him go systematically to the next map area and keep trying. \n\nNote: when you use a map, it'll show a white icon where your player is. If you go outside the map area, the icon changes to a little circle on the very edge, which indicates your direction. So for example if the white icon is at the bottom of the map, that means that you are south of the map area. Hope that makes sense. \n\nSo the point is, he can watch how the map icon changes in order to see where to start a new one. \n\nHe can also systematically place the maps in his inventory so he knows which is which. \n\nHe can also place them on a grid of Glowing Item Frames (on a floor or wall), to keep the maps together. \n\nOh, and keep the current map in your offhand while walking.

Eventually, I did find it, years later.\n\nNow, looking back, I\u2019m glad it took me so long to find it all. I was able to look around and see what I\u2019d been able to build at a much younger age, and compare it to what I\u2019d been able to do more recently. I never edited or added anything. I left it just as it was, and that world still exists.\n\nSometimes I still load it up just to see what it was like back then.\n\nI was older then than your son is now, but if this story meets a similar fate, don\u2019t let him delete that world.

You may try following the instructions given in [this five years old Reddit answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/bokqmz/comment/enhfwmg/) and, if that doesn't work or is no longer available, you can use the free trial for Minecraft Realms to do so as described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/132ut1r/comment/ji6uujw/) (you would need a Windows PC with Minecraft Bedrock Edition for this option to work).\n2. Open the world in a mapping program made for Bedrock Edition worlds (the one I've used is Unmined from https://unmined.net). These programs let you see a map of your world that not only shows biomes and geographical information but builds as well. The benefit from using a program like this one is that it would only show areas of the world where your kid has been already, so it would narrow down the search considerably.\n\nGood luck!",

It adds your standard rpg mini map to the corner, waypoint system, navigation, etc. Extremely useful, especially for creative when you have a LOT of builds!\n\nAlso, no more need for manually writing coordinates! It will require a mod loader, so you'll have to do some research on that. \n\nhttps://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap",
