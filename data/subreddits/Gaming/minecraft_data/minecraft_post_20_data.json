I used to have stable 60 fps with no problem and suddenly I am happy to get 40. My GPU is Geforce GTX 1650, Mods I am using are posted in the screenshots including a resource pack (I am also using Vanilla Tweaks but they weren't the issue). Yes, I have tried to turn them all off (made no diff). Yes, I have tried to turn my render and other distances to less than 28 (also made no diff). It usually runs okay after I restart my laptop but when I don't it's like this. Thank you for any ideas. I am happy to answer any questions!\n\n  \nEdit: This is list of the mods on the server (there is actually a little less, I can state all of which were removed if it matters)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/HermitCraft/comments/1ahuli4/hermitcraft\\_s10\\_world\\_info/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HermitCraft/comments/1ahuli4/hermitcraft_s10_world_info/)",

The problem was probably in the Java version I was using (17.0.8) as of right now Java 22 is the newest (You can download it [here,](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#zulu) just scroll down a little and download the .msi file) Zhyver also pointed out to me that the modpack was missing one very significant performance mod (I will post the new modlist in the reply of this comment). I was also using CurseForge previously which wasn't able to load my new Java version. We fixed this by using MultiMc launcher which is much better by the way. The game now runs at minimal 59 fps without Vsync with all the mods. Will try shaders later and update yall.\n\nThat's all for now, thank you for your help and time everybody! Especialy you u/Zhyver <3!",
