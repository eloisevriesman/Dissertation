It's pretty innovative, with interesting features like:\n\n - Standing there menacingly\n\n - Being insanely hard to kill\n\n - Probably being really good at killing you\n\n - Having some form of jumpscare mechanic, in the form of spawning in really close to you and/or by playing a loud noise while it's chasing and/or attacking you.\n\n- Having a big creepy smile and lanky design, unlike the previous 262936 mods, which only featured *large mildly unsettling* smiles.\n\n - Being really useful for the over reactive Minecraft let's player in your life.",
