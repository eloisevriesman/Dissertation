NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG.**\n\n---\n\n**Minecraft Snapshot 24w21a** - A Minecraft Java Snapshot\n\nThis week we're bringing a Snapshot you can vibe out to! This time around we're bringing data-driven jukeboxes, a new gamerule, and a bunch of fixes.\n\nHappy vibing!\n\nChanges\n-------\n\n* It seems we cooked a bit too hard with the new Piston sounds last week, which is why we're reverting back to the old sounds again\n* Lowered volume of original sounds to address initial feedback of Pistons being too loud\n* Pause menu now can include a list of links provided by server\n* Improvements to the disconnection screen\n* Any member of a Realm can now upgrade a world\n* In the Realms main screen, all online players of a Realm are displayed\n    * When hovered, a tooltip is shown with each player's head and name\n\n### Vault\n\n* Added sound effect to help players understand they've already looted a vault\n\n### Trial Chambers\n\n* Trial Chambers are less likely to generate in the Deep Dark\n\n### Animal Panic\n\n* Animals now panic based on the damage caused by predefined Damage Source Types\n* The panic lasts for 2 seconds after the damage is dealt. The following damage type tags are used by vanilla animals:\n    * panic\\_environmental\\_causes: Used by Wolves, Polar Bears (adults) and Pandas\n    * panic_causes: Used by all other animals and baby Polar Bears\n\n### Server links\n\n* Servers can now provide a list of links to clients\n* If client has received any links, a new button called \"Server Links...\" will show up in pause game screen\n    * To make space for that button, \"Report Bugs\" and \"Give Feedback\" buttons might be moved into a sub-screen if necessary\n\n### Disconnection screen improvements\n\n* In some cases client will now store detailed information about disconnection (similar to crash reports)\n* When that happens, new \"Open Disconnection Report Directory\" button will be added to the disconnection screen\n* When server provides link for bug reporting, it will be also be added as a button to the disconnection screen\n\nTechnical Changes\n-----------------\n\n* Resource Pack version is now 34\n* Data Pack version is now 45\n* Server can now provide list of links to client\n* Servers can add custom details to crash and disconnection reports\n\n### Gamerules\n\n* Added new entitiesWithPassengersCanUsePortals gamerule\n    * When true, entities with passengers can use Nether Portals, End Portals and End Gateways\n    * Defaults to false\n\n### Server links\n\n* New clientbound packet server_links is available in configuration and game protocols\n* On receival, client will make links available from pause menu\n* Link labels can be built-in or custom (i.e. any text)\n* Some built-ins also have special fuctionality:\n    * report_bug:\n        * link will be displayed on disconnection screen, if disconnection was caused by packet handling error\n        * link will be included as a comment in disconnection report\n* Added bug-report-link to server.properties to allow vanilla server to configure report_bug links\n    * If this field is non-empty, server will send that link to clients\n    * This field should contain well-formed URL\n\n### Custom server crash report details\n\n* New clientbound packet custom\\_report\\_details is available in configuration and game protocols\n* This packet contains a list of key-value text entries\n* If received, contents of this packet will be added in a separate section to any crash or disconnection report generated during connection to this server\n\n---\nContd...",
