Instead you should place the trap doors on the edges of the window with glass blocks behind the shutters, yes this'll give you a 2 block wall, but it just gives you more options with your interior. Next id place stripped birch logs on the side of the window. Right under the window place 5 blocks of leaves on the exterior.",
