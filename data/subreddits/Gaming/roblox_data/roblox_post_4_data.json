            "body": "The hub is the best part. By far the most genuine-feeling part of the event, the team that made it definitely grew up with Roblox and knew their stuff well. Wasn't expecting the \"guess the name\" walls to show up (especially since 99% of the time back in the day those used copyrighted characters), and it was nice to see HelperBot from Welcome to Roblox Building make a return. I also like how The Classic's event page suggests Tix will actually be a permanent event currency alongside tokens\u2014they were never going to bring it back in full but at this point *any* permanent history callbacks are appreciated\u2014though maybe they should've used Player Points instead of tokens. One joke I actually found kinda funny: the 35 Tix item \"Mom's Dog\", which is a reference to old RP games where there was always someone using the dog or baby morph and asking for a family. Seeing that type of stuff actually brushes really close to Roblox rules on ODers, they must've really had to find a way to argue that one through.\n\nThe existence of secrets in the hub adds to the wanderlust which I like. You could spend a whole day of the event searching the hub with friends. I know soon this sub is going to be full of spoilers, but the existence of game secrets with zero assistance reminds me of when I was younger playing Roblox and other games, because I rarely checked the forums (using it at all was a free warn) and most games were simply not designed to have a community nor guides, so if a game had a secret badge or whatever, either you serverhopped to find someone who knew and would help you, or you got down to searching.\n\nLots of event stuff I don't really understand though, like what the Tix tower is for or why the drink vending machine seems to be important enough to require a 4 Tix coin and a careful selection. But I'm sure that stuff will come later, and will inevitably be fully explained in this sub.\n\nHaven't tried the other games in the event. Partially don't want to. Everyone says \"where's the classic games???\" without realizing there's a reason Roblox, a public corporation with profit-desiring shareholders, always selects their most popular high-revenue games for events, and never older games with lower playercounts that predate DevEx. Still, would've been nice if they got to officially tag along.\n\nIn all, so far, quite surprised. I thought this was gonna fucking blow, and it only *sort of* did. Shame nothing permanent will come from this like retro site themes or client skins. Roblox would definitely win me over if they announced something like that by surprise right as the event ends, but you know they won't, I know they won't, we all know they won't.",

My praises end there sadly, as i am not a fan of how prizes are obtained. The fact that you have to do well over 35 tasks to do all items, as you lose your tokens when you get a prize. One could argue that it makes the event too easy, and that is a fair point, but i feel as if the hunt's system with prizes was better, as you could continue onto the next item.\n\nAs for the games? Not a fan. From the few i've played (Bee Swarm,Arsenal,TTD,TDS,Driving Empire) most felt painfully reliant on 2 players, as else they were tedious to do (Like Arsenal, TTD if your only there for event with 0 progress) or basically straight up P2W (\\*Coughs Driving Empire\\*), Some were not too bad (TDS was pretty solid tbh). I think the theme of late 2000s - 2012ish Roblox was cool, but the tasks let it down, and i think it's the events main shortcomings. The tasks just feel too monotonus and/or grindy to justify playing it after a while. The 5 day timeframe does not do the event any favours either, as it should be 7-10 Days to be honest.\n\nOverall, its a 5/10 event. Great potential, but it felt wasted.",
