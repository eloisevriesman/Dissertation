These games all still have present updates and fan bases as well.\n\n1. Survive The Disasters\n2. Survival The Natural Disasters\n3. Work at a Pizza Place\n4. Blox Hunt\n5. Death Run\n6. Murder Mystery\n7. Hell, even Bloxburg fits better in the classic category compared to the games they chose.\nI'm sure others could come up with additional games to these. \n\nThis was a chance they could have taken to advertise these older games and more to really give current day players a taste of what \"classic Roblox\" is. I feel like it was blown",

With what I've said on the last part, they could have least added more portals that would connect to older roblox games. While keeping the ones that could monitize the event.",

And if Roblox really cared about making this event good, they wouldn\u2019t care about the money.\n\n> The Iron Cafe has been dead for like a decade now and has zero monetization, while I believe The Plaza is a shell of what it used to be.\n\nThere are plenty of other classic games that could be included.\n\n> Ditto with NDS and WAAPP, which while still popular, don't really have much in the way of monetization and are very focused on what the player is supposed to do (survive disasters and complete work tasks).\n\n??? How is that bad?\n\n> Another factor is how their game design doesn't really permit being able to complete side quests; you can't really hop off a match of NDS to complete an obby, for instance.\n\nDidn\u2019t stop the terrible hunt event from including lots of tasks like \u201cPlay this game for 5 minutes!\u201d or \u201cPlay this game for 10 minutes!\u201d or \u201cUnlock this thing after playing for 5 minutes!\u201d",
