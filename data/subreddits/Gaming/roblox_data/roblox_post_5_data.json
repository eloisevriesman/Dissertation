The final enemy aka toilet magnet helicopter thing had 160k+ hp and the devs said we just needed to use the starter towers. I only used some big speakerman (or cameraman idk) due to having been gifted it by a stranger and even having spammed all of them max level i couldn't even do half of the second boss' hp but fortunately it wasn't necessary that i had to kill it. but all of that combined together did not give me a good first impression of the way the devs handled the event other than the main lobby (which wasn't good either)",

Bringing back old school games to be featured in this event would be much harder to pull off, as they are largely outdated games which practically nobody plays anymore. Furthermore, the developers of those games most likely don\u2019t play Roblox anymore and/or wont be willing to revive projects they made so many years ago, especially since they\u2019d have to adjust to a new engine experience, which basically puts them back at the bottom of the learning curve. Not to mention, a good majority of Roblox users are young children; It\u2019d be like forcing them to play with toys that their parents played with. It\u2019d be a massive downgrade to them unlike their parents where that was all you could play with, or you simply did not. Now, compare that to the popular games of today, which are updated consistently, (typically) more action packed, the most popular among users which are primarily those young children from earlier, and generally just look and feel better. The developers of those games could just make one of their own classic themes instead, since they got the updated knowledge of the engine, and it would not entirely take away the luxuries, so to speak, that we can experience now, unlike the problems and limitations older games had back then.",
