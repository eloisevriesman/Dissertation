            "body": "I have a Victus gaming laptop and it runs Roblox itself just fine\u2014 but WASD doesn't function with movement, but works just fine when typing in chat. I can move with arrow keys, though.\n\nI have looked into several fixes such as:\n\n* FN + W (doesn't work)\n* Opening up and closing the On-Screen keyboard (works for like a minute before stopping)\n* I checked my roblox movement settings (Default - Classic for CAMERA) (Default - Keyboard for MOVEMENT)\n* I tried utilizing Chrome, Opera,\u00a0*and*\u00a0just the Roblox launcher itself. Each have this issue.\n* I also read that it could be some issues with Discord, having it registered as a game so I both tried:\n\n1. Removing it from Discord's registered games (didn't work)\n2. Uninstalling Discord entirely (didn't work)\n\nI cannot find any other fixes besides people just saying the same fixes as I tried above\u2014 anyone got any other ideas?",

            "body": "\nI\u2019ll tell the full story here, as i really want opinions on this or to know if this is even allowed? I got banned in blade ball pretty unfairly and it was a massive breach of my privacy. \n\nSo, this was around October last year. I was playing blade ball in a  public lobby, and an admin (Of blade ball) joined. Her name was Kitty, and after playing for a few rounds she assumed i was hacking. She told me to do a pc search or i would get banned. Of course, i wasn\u2019t hacking, so i accepted. We exchanged discords and i got added to a group chat with her, and another guy. She told me that the other person was her boyfriend and that he would be pc searching me. Not really understanding the whole situation i just didn\u2019t want to be banned so i agreed with what they told me to do. They made me download anydesk, a remote access tool that allows them access to my pc, they can move my mouse, type etc. They then searched through all of my files, downloaded searching programs like a program called process hacker, search everything, voidtools. This went on for about 15 minutes with him on my pc and i was getting kind of worried. Eventually though, after not finding anything, the admins boyfriend got off my pc and said in the chat \u201cWell you\u2019re annoying anyways just ban him\u201d And kitty did ban me. It\u2019s a permanent ban, tried to appeal but got denied. Messaged some moderators but they told me in order to get unbanned id need to give them 50k robux. I would provide screenshots but they kicked me from  the group chat after the ban, and i\u2019m banned from all blade ball servers, including the appeals discord.\n\nIm not sure if this whole screen sharing thing is even allowed? It\u2019s a huge breach of my privacy. Not to mention the fact that they actually didn\u2019t find anything, and still banned me despite me spending like 20k robux on that game. It\u2019s not even the banning that is the issue for me, it\u2019s the whole situation and the fact they did a deep dig through all of my personal files.  Just really sucks. Any advice? Can i go anywhere with this? Thanks",

They're following some random guide online and barely understanding what they're actually doing (Process Hacker is a replacement for Task Manager, for example, and won't help expose any programs that Task Manager can't see) because they want to seem like they're competent. It is a miserable invasion of your privacy, absolutely, and you do NOT have to accept someone installing a program on your computer.\n\nDo not let anyone else install AnyDesk on your computer, and don't let anyone access your personal files over a roblox game. The amount of danger you could be in if that person was malicious is exceedingly high, and frankly I'd be worried that they installed something on your computer to try to steal your Roblox password. Basic internet security and safety rules; nobody needs access to your computer directly. They should be perfectly fine with a screenshare, and if not, they weren't acting in good faith anyway. Be a skeptic.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but your robux is probably gone forever; the developer of the game does not care (especially if this is the type of admin they employ) unless they'll lose money from it, and you can't exactly revert a robux payment. I'd recommend not spending robux on games where you can be banned instantly with no appeal.\n\nFinal note: anyone offering to unban you for any robux amount is scamming you. Don't waste your time on false hope.",

I remember there was a long road that extended from the east and west sides of the map, and buildings all along it. There was a boat shop (around where you spawned) a dock where you could buy bait and sell fish I think, and it was almost always night time. You could buy boats, fish, and stuff, and there was this blue sparkle when you would catch a fish. There was a tall building that I'm pretty sure was a casino? But you could also use your items you purchased in the Roblox shop with tix. I barely remember it but I was wanting a bit of nostalgia and couldn't find it so I hoped to get some help lol, it was my favorite game, that and greenwood. If anyone could find it I'd be so grateful.\n\nEdit: I found it, but it's completely changed. Its called club nyonic. Loved that game, but I can't find the version I played anywhere",

This wasn't happening back then and it's starting to get annoying especially when I join a game and it automatically sets me in an SG server (which has the highest ping somehow).",

Do I need to use a VPN? Does Roblox even allow that?\n\nI could just follow them from their profiles or make a private server, but there are games where the \"main\" game is not in the starter place, so those options don't always work.
