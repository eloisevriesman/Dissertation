Marvel basically tried to replace Mutants with Inhumans, and set up a lot of story lines in the comics between 2007 and when Disney acquired Fox that made X-men kinda suck (only really turning around in 2019 with House of X). Its why Kamela Khan was an Inhuman (though now they've hilariously retconned that either she's a mutant or both), and why in the shows they were setting up stories that were carbon copy mutant stories just as ""inhumans"" instead. 

Funnily enough, since 2019, Inhumans have basically vanished from the comics. I think Black Bolt has had less than 5 appearences since 2019, and he's one of the most important characters in the Marvel world.

I would say that it wasn't necessarily regret, more so an understandable sacrifice. For example, we didn't have time to implement a true fog of war system because we had other elements (combat, enemy AI, etc.) that would  give the player a better experience overall. There was a few of those, hah! 

One element that did get cut that didn't make sense was that the player could flip between 4 masks (Maskless counted as a masked state to a degree). When playing it over and over, it didn't make sense so we went down to 2 masks.

I'd say there are many elements I'm proud of with this game, but the biggest one is the Reflection moments - the player simply sitting under a tree and increasing their chances of survival by speaking about how they feel.",0.0237338446837421,0.012682020664215,0.9973013997077942,0.0112436115741729,0,0

I would say the biggest advice I can give is to find the time to just do it. Start slowly and just start somewhere. Zau started with the idea of depicting grief and with the character. The level design element started with me drawing on paper. If you can get the ball rolling, you'll find those finer details the deeper you get into it. It's just about giving yourself that small push. Pirate Software is a great person to listen to in regards to just getting into making games!

For example, we recorded all of Tales of Kenzera's dialogue in two weeks. We then implemented it in game, realised some bits didn't make sense, and needed to do an additional week of pick ups.

There is such a power to be drawn upon when going on the journey of grief. It reminds us that we can be loved and have the capacity to love. It shows us we're human. If anything, this game has definitely empowered me, and I feel others too.
