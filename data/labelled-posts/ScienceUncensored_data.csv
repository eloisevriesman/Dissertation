*U.S. Department of Energy Announces $10 Million for Projects Working to Develop and Domestically Manufacture High Performance Superconductors.* 

The original peer-reviewed LK99 superconductor paper only briefly mentions the thin film work and measurements. In August and September 2023, the consensus of other labs was that LK-99 is not a superconductor at any temperature but only bulk non-thin film samples have been made. None of replications have gone through the peer-review process of a journal.

However, this is the most important part because only the chemical vapor deposited thin film has the zero resistance superconducting measurement.  The original team says that the thin film chemical vapor deposition process is the only one that has superconducting resistance. The thin film is microns thick and is nearly half superconductive material. See also:

White strings in grocery meat (compact or minced) seem to be a new trend on social media [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Whatisthis/comments/yxf0vy/i_found_white_string_like_hair_in_ground_beef), [2](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/yxf0vy), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/yxepzg/white_string_like_hair_in_ground_beef), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/steak/comments/uy1oyr/what_is_this_stringy_stuff_in_my_beef/) .. Intriguingly most people in comments never noticed them before. A little white worms found in beef can be a tapeworm species known as Taenia saginata, Taenia solium, Taenia asiatica etc. They in fact cause a parasitic infection called taeniasis in humans.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/15tq0vd/the\_bizarre\_study\_that\_was\_used\_to\_practically/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/15tq0vd/the_bizarre_study_that_was_used_to_practically/)

The tl;dr is: they downplayed a study with sufficient sample size due to arbitrary/subjective reasons (that the ""endpoint"" was not ""good enough"" even though according to common sense it was clinically meaningful)... and yet they based their decision on another study that had an insufficient sample size: this study only had about 250 people in the fluvoxamine group and around the same number of people in the placebo group. For a disease that causes less than 5% severe illness in people without any immunity, to begin with, that means roughly only 10 people out of 250 would be expected to get severe illness even without any sort of intervention or vaccine. So when you only have around 250 in each group, and around 15 might get severely ill... fluvoxamine would be expected to lower that number of 15 but not by 100%.. so perhaps it might lower it to something like 7 or 8.. and in the placebo group because there is no intervention we would expect around 15.. but in this study they found only 15 in placebo group vs 13 in fluvoxamine group.. well.. when your sample size is so small.. those numbers are way too small to draw any conclusions from..

The other study (that they dismissed due to their subjective/arbitrary decision that the ""endpoint"" was not ""good enough"").. had a much higher sample size.. around 750 in each group.. and they found 119 in the placebo group clinically deteriorated vs 79 in the placebo group... \[119 vs 79\] vs \[15 vs 13\].. 15 vs 13? Are you kidding me? That is way too small for both groups to draw any meaningful conclusions from. Yet they chose to base their decision on that study, and strangely downplayed the study that showed 119 vs 79. It is quite literally bizarre that they can get away with something like that. It is basic math, logic, and common sense, but again, very few people care about these things, and only around 2% of people can understand these basic statistical concepts, this is how they get away with their bizarre decisions.",0.0480130448683132,0.0269938707351684,0.8998220562934875,2.950429916381836e-05,0,1

Here we can see [a picture of colliding galaxies](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hsXrp8Xs3dq8CVPo25KATK-1920-80.jpg), this one on the bottom NGC 2937 is definitely much older (oval and yellowish) and as such surrounded by thick coat of dark matter. It looks smaller but it's actually much heavier just thanks to invisible field of dark matter around it. The  NGC 2936 galaxy ""above"" it is younger (the pink clouds of molecular hydrogen are still forming in it) and being lightweight it collides and wraps around dark matter field of NGC 2937 galaxy at distance. Like if the old galaxy would be surrounded by a thick coat of invisible jelly or something similar.  

The visible matter separating effect of dark matter manifests itself just with [distinct color pattern of galaxies](http://i.imgur.com/UFsfUZb.jpg). The core of most of galaxies (including Milky Way) is formed with yellowish older mature stars of high metallicity, despite the concentration of interstellar gas is maximal there. These stars remain cold and yellow, because they're starving of interstellar gas which is kept hot with dark matter so that it can not gravitate into stars and power nuclear fusion there.

With compare to it, the galactic arms have blue color, which means, they're formed with hot short living and freshly formed stars. The extreme example of this paradox is the [Hoag's object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoag's_Object), which is probably merger of two galaxies of very different age. See also:

we just have to guess on whether it is true or not.

Personally I am not too convinced, because this is Pfizer yet Moderna had identical side effects, does this mean the exact same production problem happened with Moderna? And not just Pfizer and Moderna, but virtually all spike protein based vaccines, regardless of whether they are mRNA or not, cause abnormally/astronomically higher rate of adverse effects compared to non covid vaccines. Also, Moderna has a higher rate of adverse effects, and we know it has 3x as much mRNA so 3x as much spike protein. And there are studies showing the spike protein independently appears to be causing heart issues. So my own hypothesis is that these vaccine adverse effects are due to the unnatural toxic spike protein of this accidentally lab leaked artificial virus, and the more spike protein you get the higher chances of symptoms. That would explain why the virus, and all spike protein based vaccines, are all causing the same sorts of symptoms. It would also explain why milder covid results in relatively less long covid symptoms but can still cause long covid symptoms: less spike protein proliferates in the body but there is spike protein in the body nevertheless.",0.0295429554215693,0.0093934535980224,0.9642394185066224,5.0008296966552734e-05,0,1

> What is TTS?

>Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is a rare condition reported in some people who have received adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines [such as the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine]. The syndrome is characterised by blood clot formation (thrombosis) combined with low platelet levels (thrombocytopenia).
> TTS is different to other more commonly diagnosed blood clotting conditions as it is triggered by an immune response that causes the combination of both clots and low platelets.
>Having a history of blood clots, like deep vein thrombosis (DVT), does not increase your risk of TTS due to the AstraZeneca vaccine.



> Risk of death due to TTS from receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is 1 in a million

> Risk of TTS from receiving the AstraZenecaCOVID-19 vaccine is less than 30 in a million

One thing I didn't know is:

>Deaton said rightwing politicians and economists fixed the numbers so they could claim, in the words of Ronald Reagan, that in the war on poverty, poverty won. Official income statistics left out welfare payments so those receiving them often appeared to still be living below the poverty line when, by other measures, government assistance demonstrably helped.

I've always wondered about this.  I prefer creativity and socialization over consumption, which means I spend very little.  So because of that despite having plenty of money, I tend to spend below the poverty line out here in Silicon Valley, which is about 57k.

If I ate out every day of the year at a decent sit down restaurant I would spend 36k, combined with an above median rent of $2000 a month I'd spend 60k a year, I'd be just over the poverty limit.  This seems insane to me.  I can live comfortably, regularly travel to Europe for vacation, eat out, have a decent reliable car, and still be in poverty?  The numbers always seemed off to me.  Apparently out here all those things are not enough to be considered a liveable wage.

Now to be fair, that would be a bit tough with a kid, but the poverty limit is set based on size of household, so 57k is one person.  It goes up for two people, and a kid is a 3rd person, so it goes up higher to account for that.",0.0415525095717269,0.0336813926696777,0.9996775388717652,0.001045137643814,0,0
post_17,post_17_3,1.0,0.0,"Hey hey guys, a British royal title guy who has been working and teaching at Princeton since the 1980s is now on the side of the poor!! For real guys.

He's seriously concerned about white people dying, especially via what he and Case call [deaths of despair](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190785/deaths-of-despair-and-the-future-of-capitalism), i.e. drug and alcohol deaths and suicides. Of course our polluted water and air and food haven't played a role, duh! Or any of that other stuff. We've been CHOOSING to poison OURSELVES!!

And you know what else doesn't play a role, because Case and Deaton didn't even think to mention it in their book? Student debt. BOOM. Economists from Princeton know that crushing debt is sort of like, an insignificant detail. Because of course no one who hasn't graduated has student debt, and in fact, college educated people are currently [flourishing.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/opinion/life-expectancy-college-degree.html) (\*\* please correct me if I'm wrong. I thought I paid careful attention while listening to their book but could've missed something. \*\*)

You can tell Deaton really cares about the poor because he's promoting progressive policies like [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/opinion/life-expectancy-college-degree.html):

>We are encouraged by the efforts of both public and private employers to remedy this; it is a low-cost policy that could have large benefits. For example, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania signed an executive order removing the B.A. requirement for 92 percent of state jobs; similar policies are in place in Utah, Maryland, Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey and Alaska.  
>  
>Anything that reduces health care costs would help, as would replacing employer-funded health insurance with vouchers paid for by general taxation. Fighting NIMBYism (residents’ “not in my backyard” opposition to local development) and expanding affordable housing in successful cities would increase mobility. Job creation under the Inflation Reduction Act is a move in the right direction. Working people would do better with stronger unions and fewer hostile measures such as right-to-work laws.

Did he say ""vouchers""? Oh wait . . . is Sir Dr. Deaton from Princeton possibly trying to distract us from ACTUALLY progressive policies, such as universal health care, free (and public?) post-secondary education, stricter water, air, and land protections, undoing the hoarding of real estate by the wealthy, more rigorous food safety standards, jobs guarantees, student debt relief, support for small farmers and action against conglomerate farms, etc. Though it is cool he is advocating for unions . . . but history shows that union gains can be easily undone as needed. Hmmmmmm.

(And a bit of extra fun, the Princeton economists also say that its our [mental distress](https://qz.com/583595/deaths-of-despair-are-killing-americas-white-working-class) that caused some of us to support Bernie Sanders, rather than any sincere and rational belief in the need for collective action.

Also ""millions"" is just a ""whoa this sounds big!"" but considering that there live ""millions"" of people in GB you are at what order of magnitude? Right, 1 pound per person per year. Maybe as low as a tenth or as high as 10 times that. _Depending on how many millions._

Arguing the grid needs to be expanded **requires** a cost analysis. Perhaps expanding the grid is more expensive than shutting down a few wind turbines? Perhaps we can find a nice formula or even an easy rule of thumb to determine a threshold for policymakers and utilities. Of course the cost analysis would have to take into account the value of each kWh curtailed at the time it is curtailed. Obviously the price of electricity is not constant.
