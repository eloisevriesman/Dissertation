post_1,post_1_8,1.0,2.0,"A friend of mine was an openly Marxist when he was younger. I was a neoliberal when I was younger. 

It all fundamentally and seriously changed when we got in college. 

My friend saw the marxists there and - I'll use his phrasing - ""what kind of people they associate themselves with"". He basically turned, to say it once more in his words, an ""anti-woke"" Marxist. When we met with each other and spoke about politics, I always pointed at the contradictio in terminis and now he's slowly moving toward the centre-left. 

I, myself, pulled more toward the rightwing. I was originally a neoliberal but slowly evolved, by becoming more and more aware of certain fields, to the rightwing. I'll be the first to admit I flirted with the radical right. Was it truly my opinion? No. Was it me trying to shock others? You may bet your ass. I become more moderate when I entered college, having to discuss what I think and people that would question what I said. It was a rough/rude awakening, but necessary. 

It firmly dragged me from populism and radicalism, and toward what I am now: a conservative. I would place myself between the centre-right and rightwing, but I have rejected 1) populism and 2) radicalism. 

 My other friends went the same route as me: They went from neoliberalism to conservatism in varying degrees. The radical right never gained as much ground with them, as they weren't exploring politics as much as I did.

Based upon my experiences, most younger people will become more radical and they're much, much more prone to fall for revolutionary, radical rhetorics.

Quite possibly yes, but that's not the alternative being prescribed in the article.

The article says an effective counterinsurgency strategy is to ""Clear, Hold, Build"", i.e. Clear enemy militant activity from an area, Hold the now cleared territory 24/7 and provide security, and then Build up humanitarian services and recover from damage caused by the initial military action. 

The article's author asserts the Israeli strategy only considers the first element, `clear`, a mistake US forces have also made.

I was just wondering what kind of vision liberal voters had for universal healthcare in the US. More specifically how broad would coverage be, and what medical procedures/medicine might not be covered? Would it just follow similar guidelines as current private healthcare coverage or would it cover all medical care one might have, regardless of “necessity”. 

Just to give examples: 

Ozempic- Currently most private insurance companies only cover the medicine if it is prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It is (typically) not covered when prescribed off label as a weight loss drug. Would a universal healthcare system cover the cost of such a drug?

Cosmetic surgeries - insurance companies cover plastic surgeries when it is required due to illness or an accident. Ie. If a breast cancer patient has a mastectomy, insurance will cover the cost of breast implants. Meanwhile elective plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons is almost always paid for out of pocket. Would this remain the case under universal insurance?

Also what about gender affirming care? I know currently most insurance covers trans related healthcare, but this often requires a gender dysphoria diagnosis/letter of recommendation from a doctor. But how do it apply to cis individuals? I saw a Reddit post once talking about how balding is an example of gender dysphoria in cis individuals, I actually really liked the comparison and found it informative, but would something like hair implants be covered for cis individuals? Would they only be covered for women due to societal standards? 

I am genuinely curious how universal healthcare would decide what is and isn’t covered, because while I think it’s a more reasonable to fear limited coverage, on the other hand too broad of coverage seems susceptible to abuse and overspending.

Think Medicare, but covering everyone.

Like current Medicare, you would be able to get Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medicare advantage (if you wanted that for some reason). The tax-funded, universal component would cover essential care for everyone—you would have the option to buy additional supplemental insurance (ex. Privately, or through an employer) to cover additional things the base insurance doesn’t cover. Billing and payment and such would all follow through the same backend system to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort, even for supplemental coverage. 

HHS (in conjunction with relevant legislation and possibly the courts) would make determinations on what to cover, when to cover it, how much to cover, etc. 

> Would a universal healthcare system cover the cost of such a drug?

For its on-label uses.

> Would this remain the case under universal insurance?

Seems like the sort of thing to let the system and relevant experts sort out—where the line between medically necessary care for quality of life and vanity lies.

> Also what about gender affirming care?

That should be covered as medically necessary, and would be covered under the sort of society which would create a universal healthcare system.

There are some very important differences though: There is no-one in the loop between the doctor and the patient to approve or deny treatment. What threatments are covered is set on the national level without an army of minor bureaucracts covering or denying treatments individually.

Also, coverage for a condition will never be refused except on medically neccessary grounds. What can be an issue is which drugs or treatments can be applied.

After a couple hours here I have to wonder if the multitude of clearly non-citizens all wearing the same outfits with their folders and baggy that have been boarding flights to multiple cities by the dozens somehow have an effect on the demand side of this equation and are part of the reason my flights are so expensive now…

post_5,post_5_9,0.0,3.0,"Interesting question.

I think it would be very difficult to make the claim that lack of education, ignorance, or even stupidity are the key factor that makes people support right wing policies and politicians in the US. From what I can see, especially over the last 20 year or so, the key motivating factor for Americans on the right is anger, dissatisfaction, and maybe even spite. Sure, poor education contributes to those feelings, but I dont think it is causal. Additionally, I think people on the left need to acknowledge that in some key ways, the anger that motivates people on the right is justifiable, even if we profoundly disagree on the cause of that anger or how to fix it. 

Personally, I don't see access to education, in this context, as all that difference than access to any other resource, like healthcare, social saftey nets, and/or affordable housing. My reading of the current climate is that right wingers are primarily upset due to difficulties with accessing these resources, perceptions that they face difficulties to accessing these resources, and believing that their access to these resources is being threatened by outsiders.

So, with this in mind, I do think better access to education would make the right significantly different. Not because they would become smart enough to change their views, but that the anger they feel would be diminished and replaced with a degree of civic pride/enthusiasm. Similarly, I would apply that same logic to accessing any vital resource.  

This is where I think the Democratic party has failed. They are failing to really improve access to resources in the communities where right wingers typically live. Additionally, in some cases, they dont do a good enough job at making sure these communities understand that it is Democratic policy that is giving them access. This is a big reason why I am a communist. We cant lecture the right wing into abandoning their position. We need to actually deliver what they need, where they are at. Once that is done and we can improve their material conditions in a measurable way, we can bring them back from the current wave of reactionary thinking.

Finally, I understand that in many ways it is right wing policy which is destroying their access to resources. I have worked in health care and public schooling for the last 10 years and I find it equal parts frustrating and amusing when right wing families (and they often like to tell everyone just how right wing they are) complain about the horrible state of the systems which their policies destroyed. However, rubbing their noses in it utterly fails to win them over, and infact just makes them more angry, perpetuating the cycle. I am not sure if the cycle is intentional, but if right wing politics and media intentionally built this cycle, it is pretty brilliant.",0.0381920662429136,0.0008684694766998,0,0.00981205701828,0.999645471572876,1
