post_1,post_1_1,0.0,3,"I'm going to limit my comments to Wagner *in Ukraine*. [Here's a link to an article on Wagner in Africa post-Prigozhin.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-30/russia-recruiting-africa-army-to-replace-wagner-group?srnd=politics-vp) This may already be a rambling comment; it's a rambling, sprawling topic. I also don't deserve to be the spokesperson on this topic ... but everything else got deleted and I think I can do well enough.

In Ukraine, [Wagner was officially disbanded.](https://time.com/6290536/russia-wagner-group-disbanded-ukraine/) Members were given the choice of voluntarily moving to other units or move to Belaruse, which was ultimately the same choice but more circuitous. When Wagner were integrated into the Russian army, every assault-capable Russian force was ground down and portions of Wagner had just engaged in history's weirdest mutiny. There were various reasons Wagner was broken apart. So Wagner soldiers ended up all over. Many joined similar groups and there are example of veteran status being leveraged – placement also wasn't purely random. For example, the 'Kamerton' unit of the 'Akhmat Special Forces' somewhat recently fought around the flanks of Bakhmut and is reportedly mostly ex-Wagner. In Avdiivka, the 115th Special Brigade of the Rosgvardia was active, which included many former Wagnerites. There are examples of Wagner veterans of Bakhmut assault squads being given non-Wagner assault squad leadership like was seen in attacks around the Sand Quarry in Avdiivka. Other times, it's totally piecemeal. The Russian military obviously doesn't post its composition publicly, so this is sourced from Telegram channels. Take it with a grain of salt and know it's an anecdotal look at where these soldiers went post-Wagner ... and through a very opaque outside vantage.

So anyway, no more Wagner. But I think it's worth asking what about Wagner remains beyond the individuals scattered throughout the Russian armed forces. I would lump that response into three parts: 1) PMCs, 2) Wagner's recruiting methodologies, 3) The Wagner assault model as seen in Bakhmut, etc..

So, PMCs. Wagner was different from other PMCs – it may not be helpful to ask if there are other Wagners out there. Three things happened to make them special. 1) The Russian army failed to break through Ukrainian lines in the Donbas, 2) [Wagner succeeded in Popasna with a paltry 2,000 soldiers in May, 2022,](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/07/inside-the-wagner-uprising) and 3) Prigozhnin leveraged that success into a ""pitch"" of sorts: give me disposable people from prisons and I will repeat Popasna elsewhere. So Wagner was enlarged in Summer, 2022. [By June, 2022, Prigozhin was claiming 25,000 soldiers.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66005256) This was Prigozhin's bid to control a private army that could serve as the 'assault engine' of the Russian armed forces, creating breakthroughs and meeting strategic goals while regular Russian forces essentially held ground. This size, role, support were completely unique and not representative of Russian PMCs. The concept was then [tested at Bakhmut](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/25/wagner-chief-says-20000-of-its-troops-killed-in-bakhmut-battle) and resulted in the infamous kerfuffle of underperformance and MoD rivalries. Afterwards, there was a reshuffling of how PMCs relate to the invasion of Ukraine. They do exist after Prigozhin's death. For example, [a former Wagner commander founded a PMC named ""Convoy"".](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/03/26/armed-to-the-teeth) Gazprom (yeah, *that* Gazprom) has a PMC that's, on paper, supposed to defend gas interests, but now has a unit in Ukraine. But these units are relatively small and always subservient to the MoD. First, soldiers [now sign contracts with both the PMC and the MoD.](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-backs-push-mercenary-groups-sign-contracts-despite-wagners-refusal-2023-06-13/) Secondly, equipment and supplies are used as leverage over the groups. Finally, they are structured inside of larger Russian formations with limited autonomy. Redut Galaxy is a PMC living under the 1st Division in a recon role. Interestingly, they have responsibilities around recruitment at a higher level than they operate militarily – so much so that [RFE has called them a ""fake PMC"".](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-redut-fake-pmc/32651874.html) So we won't be seeing another Wagner in Ukraine, but Russia still sees value in PMCs: not only can it farm out recruitment, but PMC deaths are not counted, and their participation gives combat experience to PMCs that may have a role abroad, etc.. But for now, in Ukraine, PMCs are being tucked neatly under the MoD.

The Wagner recruitment model is clearly losing steam, though. Although Wagner advertised all over (on [Pornhub](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-pornhub-wagner-recruiting-ukraine-war/32321052.html) in [schools,](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/3/21/23622615/ukraine-war-bakhmut-wagner-group-russia) bilboards, etc.) the bulk of Wagner at its height and for its main purpose [came from prisons.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62911618) The low hanging fruit on that tree has obviously been picked – Russia isn't creating enough criminals who would like to go to Ukraine to keep pace with need, even though [the practice continues with the Russian army.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67175566)

The type of assault that Russia is leaning into (see: Avdiivka vs. Vuhledar) was popularized at Bakhmut. Russia is only able to effectively take land without catastrophic loss (in the immediate sense – there's discussion to be had about dwindling stockpiles of refurbishable equipment) is based on small group infantry ""reconnaissance in force"" assaults, with tanks, IFVs, etc. used for support rather than the traditional massed breaching role. Russia opens a single focused area of battle at a salient (e.g. Bakhmut, Avdiivka, now likely Robotyne) and it is hammered with indirect fire (now including glide bombs) while Russian infantry die in droves to eventually create a strategically-marginal, usually symbolic victory. Assuming the point is greater than symbolism, I would suggest that the hope is to create an unsustainable long-term situation for Ukraine's defenders, and/or create propaganda points for internal consumption (upcoming Russian ""election"") and external propaganda (wear down Ukrainian support). By all accounts, [Russia has no path to victory in the immediate future without Ukraine's foreign backing falling to pieces.](https://www.wsj.com/world/ukraines-military-spy-chief-says-russia-will-struggle-to-keep-up-the-fight-c6a5b2c5) But Russia is hammering on Ukraine's [manpower weaknesses,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/21/europe/ukraine-tough-choices-mobilization-intl-cmd/index.html) and ongoing ammunition shortages.

> Yevgeny Prigozhin was assassinated by Vladimir Putin

The linked article doesn't support this claim. In fact, it says:

> The Kremlin has denied it was behind the crash, rejecting widespread speculation that the it was a revenge assassination for Prigozhin’s short-lived mutiny in late June

So, you could find another source to support the widespread supposition that it was an assassination, or you could just leave out that part of the claim, since it's not entirely relevant to your question. It's your choice. [EDIT: There's a reference to assassination later in the submission that needs similar attention.]

> Since then, very little has been heard about of the Wagner Group in terms of their ongoing involvement in the Ukrainian-Russian war.

It's difficult to say what has or hasn't been heard by people, especially in a global forum where claims require evidence. I suggest eliminating this.

The other premise about Africa is good, as are all the questions except the last one:

Please note that nowhere above did I request ""proof,"" 100% or otherwise, that ""Prigozhin was assassinated by Vladimir Putin.""

* Almost all bills are won by simple majority. Winning by 1 vote, 4 votes, or 40 votes are all mechanically the same (though arguably subjectively different in terms of optics/spin).
* The GOP controls the majority, and therefore the speakership. The speaker sets the agenda and decides what bills to bring to the floor for a vote.
* Aside from a couple niche exceptions, that means the GOP has the power to only vote on bills it wants to pass — it's pretty rare to see a majority put up a bill they *don't* want to pass, unless they are absolutely sure it will fail anyway.

They only need to win by 1, so the relevant question isn't ""how many more votes do they have in absolute terms?"" It is: ""how close are they to *not* being able to win by 1 anymore?"" 

A single flip from yes to no actually shifts the tally by 2, since you're subtracting from one side and adding to the other.

> Such divestment can be complicated when a university’s financial relationship to a targeted company is not direct but through an investment in an index fund.

Indeed, [index funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) are diversified, making them safe and extremely popular, but it would be possible for any well-educated investor to avoid them and make targeted investments instead. The issue comes up when any institution's investing guidelines mandate low risk investing with the highest possible yields. It's hard to beat index funds for that.

> “Divestment is a rallying cry that is nationally resonant,” said Nick Wilson, a 20-year-old Cornell student involved in the protests. “We don’t want our tuition dollars going to the research and development of weapons” that may be used against Gazans.

Is it tuition dollars or endowment dollars that are going towards these investments? My understanding is that tuition dollars get spent entirely on education. In a university like Harvard, tuition revenue doesn't even cover operating expenses and [the endowment has to make up the difference to the tune of 37%.](https://finance.harvard.edu/files/fad/files/fy23_harvard_financial_report.pdf) (PDF, page 6) It's less at Columbia, with [only 12% of the budget supported through the endowment,](https://www.columbia.edu/content/financial-overview) but even so, all the tuition dollars are spent on operating expenses. They're not going to investments.

> the most consistent demand is that the college institution divest the endowments from Israeli companies and institutions

My understanding is that the demand for divestment is complicated by the fact that
[38 states](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-bds-legislation) have [anti-BDS laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-BDS_laws#Anti-BDS_laws_in_the_United_States) on the books. The list includes not just states with Republican legislatures, but also Democratic strongholds like New York and California, where many of the protests are taking place. 

These laws have passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, so reversing them would be a monumental task for the protesters. But without achieving that, university administrators are often barred from making any moves towards divestment, even if they wanted to. 

In those cases, it's hard to see how the protesters' demands are reasonable or even well-informed, but perhaps I'm missing something. What do the protest groups say about cases where their demands of university administrators conflict with state law?",0.0285426580387498,0.0455783009529113,0.9951691031455994,0.0011724829673767,1,1

The students are aware that the investments are part of the endowment and not taken from their tuition. Many universities acknowledge at the institutional level that their choice of investments ought to represent the values of the university as a place of learning populated by faculty and students, and have looked in the past to students to hear opinions on how to direct endowment funds. Some quotations from Brown University students' overview statement [Brown Divest Now](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3VLPCRi7qvMkdcWqj-2HPwR9C1Oq1uL/view):

> [Brown's Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Practices] served to represent and articulate the Brown community’s moral expectations when it comes to how our endowment is invested. (p.2)
> 
> “[Divestment] is a critically important and strong statement by the University community..."" (quotation from Brown President Ruth J. Simmons on a past decision to divest from Sudan in 2006; p.1)

The fundamental issue raised by the Brown protesters is that the university endowment's Advisory Committee already endorsed divestment in 2020. The current president rejected the committee report in 2021 and refused to bring it to the university corporation, which has been the cause of protests ever since. (p.37, footnote 9) A vote of 90% of graduate students and a supermajority of the student council have called on the corporation to implement the committee's decision. (p.22)

For Brown students, the objective of the encampment protest was simply to force the president and the corporation to agree to a vote. Last week, they reached such an agreement and dismantled their encampment.

But this brings up a host of secondary questions, including: what exactly defines a company that has ties to Israel? Is it any company that has a physical presence in the country? Agreements with the government? Customers in that country? (Does Google / Microsoft / Apple / other large American multinationals that do business in almost every country in the world count?)

This is complicated from the fact that money is fungible. On paper, it can be separated out into various inputs and outputs and trade certain money from one to the other.

post_4,post_4_4,0.0,1,"I haven’t seen many concise arguments for why they are protesting at all. In fact my sister asked me the other day why students are randomly supporting a terrorist group. 

So real quick, the October 7 Hamas attack killed around 1,200 people and 253 people were taken hostage. This includes 764 civilians killed (36 children) while the remaining were Israeli military. 

https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/02/20/the-most-tragic-victims-in-the-israel-hamas-war-are-those-who-have-no-say-in-it/

Since October 7th, Israel has killed 34,535 Palestinians and there may be an additional 10,000 under rubble. This includes more than 11,000 women and 13,800 children. 

https://www.npr.org/2024/02/29/1234159514/gaza-death-toll-30000-palestinians-israel-hamas-war

So there is a huge mismatch between deaths of Israeli and Palestinians especially among women and children (36 Israeli children and 13,800 Palestinian children in 7 months, and counting) 

Additionally, Gaza is surrounded by a wall and the two borders crossings are closed. Israel has 1 border and has closed it (because war) and Egypt is worried about Hamas among refugees sneaking into Egypt and moving the Palestine/Israel problem and turning it into an Egypt/Israel problem if Hamas attacks Israel from Egypt. 

https://www.npr.org/2023/12/12/1218388766/egypt-israel-gaza-palestinians-hamas

So for now, the 2 million people in Gaza are stuck there. Women and children who would be refugees fleeing violence are instead part of the death count. 

Killing children is a war crime. The US gives Israel military aid which has people upset and I would argue is the root of the protests. 

Colleges invest their money in the stock market including companies currently profiting by the US support of Israel in this war. Students hope that by pressuring colleges to remove stocks/investment in these companies (divesting), they can make profiting from the war unprofitable for companies as their stocks dip. Colleges have a lot of wealth and power, and students hope to twist their university’s arm into divesting from companies like Boeing will pressure these companies to stop building weapons that may be used to kill Palestinian women and children. 

https://time.com/6974063/divestment-explained-campus-protest-israel/

There’s a whole host of unanswered questions for me, like why protest colleges and not the US government directly?  But I suppose colleges are smaller fish to debate and colleges like Brown are negotiating divestment with students as a direct response to the protests.

In terms of a 'proportional response', I'm not sure about other countries operating under this constraint, but that doesn't mean it's a bad standard. I think most people agree that the US used more force than necessary in invading the middle east. I suppose you could argue that protests against that war was people attempting to place that same constraint.

I'd also push back on the identities of the victims of October 7th having to do with 'proportional responses', especially when civilian deaths are involved. What happened that day was clearly horrific and a tragedy, but when invoked in discussing the magnitude of response, I worry that it just paves the way for civilian death on the other side, which is also horrible.

Maybe that was the start.

The current conflict is happening in the Gaza strip, which didn't even exist as a separate entity during the Nakba, so maybe the Suez crisis, which precipitated the 1967 war that separated Gaza, can be blamed as the start.

Or maybe it goes all the way back to the Muslim conquests of the 7th century or the Jewish-Roman wars of the 1st century that began a long period of violence, enslavement, expulsion, displacement, forced conversion, and forced migration against the local Jewish population.

We could pick dozens of points in history to be an originating event, which is why ""who started it"" gets us nowhere. 

But if we accept the root causes as nationalism, sectarianism, tribalism, racism, and the general tendency for humans to band together to kill each other, then it doesn't really matter what start date you set.

The current protests are on about 50 campuses and the largest ones involve a few thousand protesters, per the link in my submission. From that we can calculate roughly 100,000 to 150,000 participants nationwide, plus maybe another 50,000 daily protesters in other countries. That's not counting individual marches and rallies.

The 1968 anti-war protests in the US were part of a larger, [global protest movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_of_1968) for civil rights and against state power.

Columbia student protesters were joined by 1000 faculty members, and they literally held people hostage. Draft offices were attacked. There was a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. MLK, Jr. and RFK were both assassinated that year. It was a tumultuous time.

A major driver of the conflict was that the US had conscription. Amercans' sons, brothers, husbands and fathers, disproportionately from minority communities, were being drafted to fight overseas in a war many came to see as pointless.

One aspect I've seen which is (or perhaps better stated, ""may be"") related to this question is that the president of an Iranian university had reportedly offered scholarships to students expelled over pro-Palestinian protests. A [local NBC](https://mynbc15.com/news/nation-world/iranian-college-to-offer-scholarships-to-expelled-us-student-protesters-report-says-iran-shiraz-university-mohammad-moazzeni-anti-israel-pro-palestine-middle-east-conflict-columbia-ucla) has covered it. 

> Mohammad Moazzeni, the head of Shiraz University, reportedly argued this week such protesters are being treated too harshly by police. This approach by American officials, he reportedly claimed, indicates a global collapse.
> 
>> ""They exert a lot of violence in order to contain this raging movement and have even threatened to expel the students from universities and hinder their employment in the future, and such autocratic methods show the decline of global arrogance,” Moazzeni said, according to PressTV.

> Shiraz University will also accept expelled professors, Moazzeni reportedly added.

It's not impossible, but the protests are simultaneous across more than 50 campuses and are using many of the same tactics at the same time. There's also the fact that [half of those arrested at a couple of the campus protests were non-students.](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/04/1249188864/nyc-columbia-city-college-gaza-protests-palestinian-campus)

The Reuters article I linked in the submission says the [Students for Justice in Palestine](https://nationalsjp.org/) is one of the organizers of the protests and they have a map on their site of ""Gaza Solidarity Encampments"" at various universities. The group was [founded in 2001](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/education/edlife/middle-east-conflict-on-campus-anti-semitism.html) at the University of California, Berkeley, and has been promoting divestment policies since then. It didn't suddenly spring up in response to the current war. 

SJP certainly could have used the opportunity to further their cause, but there is [ample evidence](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/how-a-generation-is-being-politicized-on-palestine) they're organizing the protests, including by circulating a tool kit in the immediate aftermath of October 7th calling the Hamas attacks “a historic win for the Palestinian resistance.”

That same article includes unsubstantiated accusations that Hamas funds SJP. Attempts by at least [one other news organization to follow the money](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/s-palestinian-protests-us-rcna143666) have been relatively fruitless as well, so we really don't know how they're funded.",0.0258023697961817,0.0121209025382995,0.9994304776191713,0.0002404451370239,1,0

It's not hard to believe this, and I did not suggest that it was. My comment did not assert with any degree of certainty that must be a connection. As I said:

And I don't think that floating the possibility of foreign actors being or trying to be involved is all that conspiratorial. For example, the [Department of Treasury sanctioned multiple Iranians](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0494) for attempting to influence the 2020 US election:

> Between approximately August 2020 and November 2020, state-sponsored Iranian cyber actors executed an online operation to intimidate and influence American voters, and to undermine voter confidence and sow discord, in connection with the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

Iran [attempted to meddle in the 2022 midterm](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/18/politics/china-russia-iran-cuba-2022-midterm-election-meddling/index.html) as well.

So I don't think it's particularly far out to suggest that Iran sees this as an opportunity to try to meddle with the 2024 election, or just to sow discord within the United States in general. The question in my mind is whether Iran was in any way an instigator or is just commenting to support or further discord (or even if the university chancellor is acting entirely individually).",0.0259530628900915,0.007754623889923,0.9748111963272096,0.0001008212566375,1,0

post_4,post_4_14_2_2,1.0,2,"Between my initial comment and the subsequent replies, I think that the rationale for why one might suspect Iran could be interested in cultivating unrest in the USA has been established fairly well. This includes but is not limited to Iran trying to interfere or sow unrest in the USA previously. And also note that I made no claim of certainty that Iran \*created\* the protests. I explicitly and intentionally identified two potential avenues, one of which was Iran simply being reactive to take advantage of the situation and try to highlight the protests.

That doesn't mean it's proven for this case (nobody has claimed such), nor that anyone must agree with the thought, but I think it's sufficiently established as reasonable. As another example, a recent [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/business/media/campus-protests-russia-china-iran-us.html) discusses precisely this concept:

>As protests over the war in Gaza have spread across the United States, Russia, China and Iran have seized on them to score geopolitical points abroad and stoke tensions within the United States, according to researchers who have identified both overt and covert efforts by the countries to amplify the protests since they began.

And regarding possibilities of success, in the past the [FBI commented on ISIL/ISIS radicalizing westerners via online channels](https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/isil-online-countering-terrorist-radicalization-and-recruitment-on-the-internet-and-social-media-). And a [report by START at University of Maryland](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_PIRUS_UseOfSocialMediaByUSExtremists_ResearchBrief_July2018.pdf) (START is a research center concerning terrorism headquartered at UMD) discussed the use of social media for recruiting/radicalizing people. It has risen dramatically over the years. For example, figures 1 and 2 highlight that from 2003 - 2010, social media accounted for roughly 26 percent of radicalization, with 73% having no social media radicalization. From 2011-2016 that basically flipped, and only 27% had no social media radicalization, while for about 73% social media played a primary or secondary role.

So I don't think it's unreasonable to consider that Iran might be able to run online campaigns to encourage unrest or protests. Again, not proven, but proof-of-concept is there, rationale is there, and past history is there. I don't think this is really a stretch.",0.0249482402740291,0.0102815628051757,0.9777700304985046,0.0078068077564239,1,0

post_5,post_5_1_1,0.0,1,"> these states don't have the ability to effectively enforce taxes on the production of illicit drugs.

I don't think this is true.  The Taliban have forced a 95% reduction in opium poppy cultivation -- if they can stamp it out almost entirely, they would find it much easier to tax it.

https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2023/November/afghanistan-opium-cultivation-in-2023-declined-95-per-cent-following-drug-ban_-new-unodc-survey.html

> Opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan plunged by an estimated 95 per cent following a drug ban imposed by the de facto authorities in April 2022, according to a new research brief from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  

> UN officials noted that the near-total contraction of the opiate economy is expected to have far-reaching consequences and highlighted the urgent need for enhanced assistance for rural communities, accompanied by alternative development support to build an opium-free future for the people of Afghanistan.  

> Opium cultivation fell across all parts of the country, from 233,000 hectares to just 10,800 hectares in 2023. The decrease has led to a corresponding 95 per cent drop in the supply of opium, from 6,200 tons in 2022 to just 333 tons in 2023.

And it sounds like there's quite an arbitrage available here.  If they lost $1 billion/year in revenue, a lot of money that could be converted to taxes -- even at an aggressive 50% tax on the excess profit, that would be $500m in the Taliban's coffers.

> Many farmers turned to cultivating wheat instead, with an overall increase of 160,000 hectares in cereal cultivation across the Farah, Hilmand, Kandahar, and Nangahar provinces. Though wheat cultivation may alleviate food insecurity to some extent, the crop generates much less income than opium – farmers in the four provinces lost around US$ 1 billion in potential income in 2023 by switching to wheat.",0.0286942410740285,0.2769649624824524,0.9737106561660768,7.18235969543457e-05,1,1
