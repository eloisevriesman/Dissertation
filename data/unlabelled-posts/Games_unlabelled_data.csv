No one is following such an example, because Dota 2 community is one of the kind that is willing to accept big gameplay changes, without crying about them like any other PvP community would do. Sadly this is not a good example that any other game should follow, as it has a huge risk of people leaving the game. Dota 2 is also experiencing this issue, as not everyone is willing to re-learn new stuff (I left after 7.00, came back a few years for a few games and left for good, now I'm just reading a big patch notes), so they are also kind of pushing it a bit too far.

post_6,post_6_1_1_4_1,"So heroes have their normal abilities they put a point into each time they level up during the game like it’s always been because thats how Warcraft 3 did it, since dota started as a mod for wc3. If you didn’t put a point into a skill, whether it was an active or passive ability you just did not have that ability at all. 

Innate passives now give a hero a passive skill that they start the game with and don’t need to put points into. They will always have that skill no matter what. 

Facets are a choice between 2 modifiers that the player picks after picking your character and before the game actually starts. An example of the one character I’ve played a match with, Drow Ranger, can pick between being able to move and use items while channeling one of her spells (channeling in dota normally requires you to stand still and not do anything else or it fails to cast the spell), or they do more damage when attacking an enemy from a higher elevation. 

It lets you tailor your teams hero picks to better synergize with each other and better counter the opponents.

* 4 abilities
* 6 items

* 1 facet ability
* Aghs + shard
* 4 talents

The problem is that all of that is ludicrously expensive, so mid and low budget titles rely on the very bare minimum.

As an example, look at the recently released Hellblade II; Hellblade II has had trailers at every Xbox event since it's announcement (as far as I'm aware) as well as a presence on the Xbox dashboard for the past few weeks, alongside a miriad of other marketing tools such as pre roll ads on YouTube and other social media sites, yet every conversation about it on Reddit was dominated by people stating it was not being marketed enough.

post_7,post_7_11,"While I did enjoy the game, for me, the game was a buggy mess at launch. I can look past the rough janky gameplay and the lower budget, as I did enjoy the story and cutscenes... but I had the game tank its frame rate several times, had the game full on crashed on me (sometimes at specific cutscenes that were actually significant to the story), and ran into a bug that forced me to replay two hours of the game.

And you know what about that last part? Apparently, that wasn't the worst bug. There was actually two other bugs that were way worse. Both of them were probably fixed by now, but for at least a month, these two bugs were present. One of them softlocked you by requiring you to use a set of keys that you get in Chapter 1 to use in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2... only for some reason the keys were coded to be used only three times total instead of one time at three different doors, meaning if you used the key on the same door in Chapter 1 (because it glitched and locks itself), then when you get to Chapter 2, you can't use the key twice, and the only option at the time was to restart the whole game if you didn't have a backup save.

The other? Way worse. In the beginning of Chapter 4 of 5, which is around 6-8 hours into the game (and damn near the end since Chapter 5 is about 20 minutes), you're meant to be locked on rails and can only go through a very specific door to trigger a cutscene. Well, what happens when that door is glitched and is also locked? For a month after launch, there was literally nothing you could do. Even the guy who had it happen to them posted a video of them restarting a save from the end of Chapter 3 and playing it again, and it still didn't fix it. At the time I was at the Discord, it wasn't fixed, and I haven't bothered to check if it has.

Like, I honestly thought me replaying two hours of Chapter 4 was bad, but at least it fixed the game and I was able to finish it. 

Also, for a game that was $60, it was lacking in content. Sure, horror games were short, and there's two campaigns, but the only difference is literally cutscenes, one singular gun, some collectibles (not even all, just some), and one specific flashback section of the game. That's it. What's worse? No unlockables. No skins, no filters, no developer commentary... unless you pay for it. Yes, you can't get anything like the classic 3DO skins, the horror filters, and the ability to hear what the developers were thinking when they were working on the game unless you pay for it. Even RE2 Remake threw you a bone with the classic costumes, unlockable weapons, and 4th Survivor/ Tofu Survivor with multiple Tofus to play as.",0.0376970290746847,0.232028663158417,0.49974799156189,6.55651092529297e-07,0,1

post_7,post_7_14_1_2,"That's what I'm saying. Everyone is all ""The marketing sucks, this could have ridden the current survival-horror wave"" but it's like, hardly anyone cares about Alone in the Dark. Even when it was bigger, it quickly got overshadowed by other survival horror series like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. Easy enough to go and read about on Wikipedia. By the time the second game was ported to consoles in 1996, it was already being compared unfavorably to Resident Evil. Even the reviews for most games in the series aren't particularly stellar. Remakes like this make me scratch my head and assume that they're primarily made because some higher ups with a fondness for the original series forced it into existence. 

A lot of the current survival horror popularity seems to come from younger gamers too, like people in their teens and 20s, Gen Z kids who played a lot of Five Nights at Freddy's growing up and watched horror reaction youtubers.

post_7,post_7_40,"It was evident by the trailers that:

1. They didn't know which direction to take the franchise, since after the original created the concept of adventur-ish survival horror, others - like Resident Evil - built and improved on it in various ways. Apart from changing perspective (make it first-person, top-down, etc., that others have already done), tweaking the inventory (that others have already done), putting more or less emphasis to either the story or action (that others have already done), what COULD they do? Ah, yes...
2. ...hire pro-level actors ""to make it more cinematic"". And, in the process, I guess they blew most of their budget on those, let's be realistic, good-but-not-top-tier actors (for they're surely not Bale and Blanchett), to give half-assed performances, for non-gamers rarely take the medium seriously.

All the while, Miss Juergens gave an Oscar-level performance for the two Senua games (OK, ""the first game and the new tech demo""), while being... er... one of the company's graphic artists and video editors?! I can safely guess she was also paid peanuts compared to Alone In The Dark's protagonists.

Damn, even the ancient Riven's cinematics felt more ""lively"" than the main characters' voices in the new AitD.

So, to recap:

- Same old setup as the originals, and dozens of games that followed.
- Same old ""formula"" of action, puzzles, and mediocre storytelling.

post_7,post_7_43_1_1,"Argument for FMVs can be made for using real actors because the alternative was drawn still images or images with very limited animation (see Dune 2 vs. Dune 2000).

Mortal Kombat's use of real people has nothing to do with having Mark Hamill or Gillian Anderson's faces in Star Citizen, other than Chris Roberts' incessant desire to make a movie game (see Wing Commander games). Or having that Stranger Things' dude's face as Edward Carnby in Alone in the Dark. Or Kojima's games featuring real actors. They are absolutely unnecessary and break the immersion and are there to stroke the egos of the developers. I'd rather have custom-made characters that don't resemble real people.

I suppose you could argue for the adventure games' usage of real people as some of them can be quite bizarre, seeing how Toonstruck has similar odd vibes as something like Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

I don't really get this argument. Cartoons and CGI exist for both forms of media, making the exact same things possible. What kind of characters are only able to made within games? Pixel characters?

>They are absolutely unnecessary and break the immersion and are there to stroke the egos of the developers.

Do voice actors do the same thing to you then? They are much the same real people, some which might be personally chosen by the directors for their roles - perhaps even speaking quite blatantly in their normal tone. Does it not break immersion, for instance, to have Mark Hamill voice act? Is Mark Hamill allowed to voice act only within the space of cartoons and not in video games?

post_7,post_7_43_1_1_1_1,"Might be just me but I feel like you are making these questions in bad faith.

No one was talking about voice actors/acting. It's an entirely different subject matter. Generally voice acting is less intrusive even if the actor is using their normal voice because most people don't recognize voice actors' voices the same way they recognize even a semi-famous actors face. I doubt most people see Nolan North's face every time Drake talks. But if Drake had North's face, it could be off-putting, especially after years of being in the spotlight of being the generic male 01 voice. And talented voice actors can change their voice when creating the character.

But Mark Hamill will always look like Mark Hamill if his face is in Star Citizen's Squadron 42. And it is miles more immersion-breaking. Because it's no longer the character in the universe of Star Citizen, it's Mark Hamill acting as the character in the Star Citizen universe. And to me it is a detriment. And it becomes even more so if the actor is someone I'm not terribly fond of.

Really enjoying this game so far but I'm thinking I might need to turn the difficulty down to normal. I think this game has had its praises sung a lot so I'm not sure how much I'm really adding to it but this game is a blast and honestly would have been worth full price if you ask me. The music is great, the art style is great, and the concept is a ton of fun. It feels like a game that was taken out of the PS2 era for all the right reasons.

It also really doesn't feel like a short game, at least not yet. I've been playing for a while on hard mode and I'm in the security center (idk if that's what it's called) area. I think some of that has to do with me playing on hard mode though, this game is pretty brutal on that difficulty and I really thought I'd be able to get through with minimal issues. The enemies introduced in this area are really tough but fair so while I might be turning the difficulty down I just think it's going to take a little while for me to get as good as I want to be.

I'm really excited to see where the game goes, every level just feels like it was made by people who were excited to work on something like this and while I know they're shut down now this feels like a nice culmination of Tango flexing their creative muscles.

To explain without major spoilers, you only have one way, one specific route on how to actually wrap up the loop and achieve your goal, which you discover not really from some massive exploration, no ""eureka!"" moment, you just have to do investigations. So all these investigations ultimately lead to opening up the way for you but...it just makes this whole system of exploring areas at different times, collecting all data and constantly ""playing the game your way"" pointless as you have to follow the guidance to beat it. Visionaries should have some sort of third option so you could make your way of beating the game. Without it it's really basic and ruins a tad whole setup. It's only A place where they are by default or B place you discover or setup to actually beat the loop. Even with that, I still recommend the game.

post_10,post_10_6,"**WoW: Mists of Pandaria Remix**

In Blizzard's quest to create as many versions of WoW as possible, they came up with this insane version of what I can only describe as ""Fuck it, we ball"" mode. It's 3 months of a bizzare version of Mists of Pandaria, but with Dragon Flight classes and talent builds, A barrage of wild abilities that you can gem into your armor that range from ""Yeah, you can be a Hunter with Blink."" too ""Execute *anything* that has 10% HP. Including bosses. *Especially* Bosses.""

It's probably the most jank, borked version of WoW I've played, with moon-logic scaling issues and a few weird bugs and bosses that aren't working properly. But it's been a fun ride as someone who skipped Pandaria to be able to experience a sort not-quite classic version of it. And some of the ideas they've experimented with a kind of neat. 

They certainly knew how to bait the hook for people to try it too, since you can buy not only some exclusive mounts and cosmetics, but also some of the 1% mount drops, and some unobtainable cosmetic armors too. So there's something you can take home to retail from it too.

Unfortunately, when I say Jank, I do mean Jank. There have been all kinds of wonky scaling issues and frustrations. It's lead to a lot of weird things such as a level 70 character doing 10% of the damage that a level 15 will do, boss damage being wildly overtuned to absurd amounts depending on who gets hit, resulting in an an attack doing anything from negligable damage to just outright one-shotting the raid, and now there's a bit of an outrage over what I will call ""Frog-gate"" resulting in some players being *wildly* more powerful and farther along than the rest of the community.

If this were a more permanant environment, I'd say a lot of these things are unacceptable.

Finished up the DLC. It offered me more of the slick combat and addictive grind as the base game, with a couple extra customizable bells and whistles, so I was very pleased. Astlibra is just a ton of fun to play, I'm definitely going to come back in a couple years and go for all achievements and clearing Impossible difficulty.

Although, I am disappointed by the cliffhanger ending. The main game introduced this weaving narrative with a lot of elements and managed to tidily wrap everything up by the end. It was satisfying. The DLC doesn't add much to the story by virtue of being a ""side story""....until it decides to end introducing a new cliffhanger element. 

I don't mind this in principle, but Astlibra was made by a solo developer who has said that he will never be able to make a game of this scale again and isn't sure if the story will continue. So it seems like such a strange decision to go out of your way to introduce a loose thread when there's no guarantee that it'll ever be followed. 

Still, I cannot recommend this game enough.

post_10,post_10_8,"**The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**

It's funny to me, checking out the current Elder Scrolls community, they're pretty divided. ESO is still going strong, Skyrim mods are absolutely crazy now, and there is a constant dispute about which game is the best one, as they are all so so different.

I grew up with Morrowind, and I can see how nostalgia blinds your perspective of older games. When people say ""Morrowind is great! Can be hard to get past the graphics, though"" or just ""Dated graphics"", that isn't the way I see it in my head. Back when I ran this thing on an original Xbox (I had no idea the number of issues the Xbox version had, I was a dumb kid that loved getting lost in a huge world) the graphics were mind blowing to me. 

* 3 minute load time (Yes I'm serious. Load times were often over 3 minutes)
* Randomly corrupted save files
* Thousands of bugs (Learned this in hindsight from recent patch mods)
* Brickable save files (Killing NPCs that soft lock you. Often times they die from hilarious bugs, like NPCs changing locations slowly over time until they fall into water and drown)

Tons more issues existed I didn't even know were a thing

I 100% recommend this to anyone wanting to get absolutely lost in a massive world, I couldn't even guess what your experience will be like compared to mine. Every aspect of this game early on made me think about who I am in this world, and let that decide my decisions. I could ramble about where my journey has taken me and who I met, and how I could restart and go about this absolutely differently.

Yes the combat feels very janky, the controller support even with OpenMW and mods is minimal (Remote playing with Steamdeck), but that doesn't stop me from getting absolutely lost and immersed in the story that is my character in this dark, racist, hostile world.

You start off weak as all sin. A rat can make you look like a bitch. Every townsperson uses racial slurs toward you. You don't have a place to sleep. If these people treat me so terribly, why should my character even be good? Stealing is clearly lucrative, why not do it? 

And as I get to the Mages guild, they're... kind? They offer me no services, but they're respectful to me. I want to join their guild. I travel to Balmora and they let me join. They're welcoming. Offer me free lodge, materials to get me started in this world. But I'm a Thief, my skills have no use here. But they offer all sorts of spells. Conjuring powerful weapons from nothing, walking on water, levitating to get on to rooves, lockpicking spells, stealth spells. I change my perspective of this world and go from equally hostile, to extending the Mages Guild treatment of the world as they have to me. I use my subtly with Magic, and practice many magical arts to increase my potential as a magic sort of nightblade.

I'm sorry for such a weird description of my early journey, but it was this that made me so immersed in this world. If I played again I'm sure I could do a completely different experience. Establish myself in the world with strength. Start early training for the Arena in Vivec, be a brute Orc focused on strength and heavy armor alone. 

I know Oblivion and Morrowind have these options too, I can't say why with Morrowind it Immerses me so much. Maybe it's the incredibly racist, hostile world? Maybe it's the extreme lack of balance, so I consider every spell and ability I come across because I know I'll end up strong anyway? Maybe it's the lack of handholding?

post_10,post_10_11,"I have such a love-hate relationship with **No Rest for the Wicked** right now. On one hand, I love the art direction, premise, the feel of the game, and combat. But on the other hand...I absolutely hate the build and weapon customization mechanics as it stands right now. Ive gotten past the stamina and durability quirks I initially had, and the fact that this feels like platform souls is a little irksome too, but those are benign to how much I do not like how the builds and weapon customization work in this game so far.

I dont mind that there are no direct classes as thats not uncommon anymore, especially for games of this nature. Pretty much in any soulslike game, even if you do start off with a class, its more of a stat point starting suggestion than anything, and then you can deviate immediate after. But right now, at the current state of it in EA, it feels like if you dont dump your points into a very specific, narrowed set of stats, you are screwed. So many builds you see people doing, they are practically dumping their stats into one thing just to get the max amount of damage. A popular consensus is that, your first character you make is always going to be a dud because you need to understand the game first, and you probably needlessly put points into a stat that you werent actually going to need. That screams bad design to me, that putting any amount of stats into another slot can wreck an entire character, even if you can create alt character, because why should my first character just become a test dummy because I put 6 points in a different stat so I could use a weapon, that a quest specifically told me to use, but I couldnt use it until I had enough points in said stat. Thankfully some form of respec'ing is coming, but still.

With the weapon customization...it just infuriates me how it works right now. Enchanting has the potential to make your weapon OP, or break it completely. You have the chance of getting mid effects that are just okay, or turn it becoming a Cursed weapon with OP stats, but completely ruining it at the same time. Like having it so that dying will result in gold loss, or exp loss, or stamina loss (which can end up stunlocking your character). But if you dont want to risk enchanting your weapon, you can always slot a bunch of gems into a white weapon for some random rolls of low-mid tier effects. But you can also upgrade your weapons to make them more powerful, up to tier 3. However, for some reason, upgrading doesnt work just one and done. No. You have to upgrade it constantly. You have to dump resources and money consistently. If I have a tier 2 weapon. I have to upgrade it 3-4 times to get it to tier 3, and then because of the state of it in EA so far, some items are sooo very rare to get, or practically not even in the game yet. So you are stucking farming for hours for certain materials, praying you have a upgraded Tier 3 vendor that will sell them, or wait 24 real time hours for them to restock with different items and hopefully have it this time. Then theres breaking my weapons completely, to get a single rune out of it to put into something else, but man...it all just feels like a bunch of micromanaging busy work, and maybe this is fun for some people, but its driving me up the wall. Break 1-3 weapons for specific runes to slot into this other weapon Im using, deciding if I want to risk enchanting and ruining it because this will also lower the amount of runes and gems I can even use for it, or just using a bunch of low-mid effect gems to enhance it instead. Then doing about 8 upgrades just to get it to a good enough tier x amount of times and resources and money later....Because so far, a common strat in the community seems to be buy/get about 10-20 copies of the same weapon until you get a version of it with x damage (because even the base stats on the items are randomized). Then once you get that, enchant those 10-20 copies until you get x randomized effects. Then after running through all those copies, slot in gems that also have a randomized percentage of stat effects on them until you get ideal one. Now youve got the OP meta stuff to take down the end of crucible boss. Yay.

Its definitely got its fans, but despite how much I love the game so far, its also one of the most tiring parts of the games for me. But like many other soulslikes, dont go to the community and ask for advice because its most toxic defenders and detractors will come out the woodworks to fight you to the def and say, ""just play the game and youll get it bro"".

post_10,post_10_11_1,"> I absolutely hate the build and weapon customization

Oh my God, so much this. I was enjoying the game until I realized how ""builds"" work. For me the progression system is uninteresting and tedious at the same time. My biggest issue is the stats are so boring, considering 4 of them only contribute to weapon scaling. Worst of all, when you level up, all you get are stats - which is boring - so leveling up feels like I'm being edged.

Additionally, since weapon drops are RNG and you have a limited moveset, exploring and finding new weapons is unmotivating. At least in a game like DS, you have a variety of movesets that factor in hitboxes, speed, and unique weapon movesets. Neutral dodge attack, crouching attack, rolling attack different than running attack, etc. Grinding out weapons to equip the same effects you can add to any generic weapon means there are effectively no builds, because you can just add/grind the meta effects. 

I guess if your an ARPG fan, this is the stuff you're into, but for me I feel like they took the foundation of DS combat, but replaced the coolest aspects with ARPG grind, without the unique ARPG class/skill/talents. It's like the most boring aspects of each genre. It's still EA, but some of the issues I have seem core to the game's concept, so I'm cautiously optimistic.",0.0737136417412404,0.0135079026222229,0.499740868806839,1.13248825073242e-06,0,1

I booted up the 1.0 and... this doesn't feel like a 1.0. Maybe a Bethesda 1.0, which might be what they're going for. I've had to deal with a lot of ridiculous bugs like falling through textures (which in a game on floating islands means certain death), NPC's being permanently asleep so you can never talk to them, and certain shortcut elevators never working so your shortcuts never open up. 

That brings up my biggest aggravation: travel. Even if the shortcuts worked, the game's layout is very confusing, so getting from place to place on foot can not only take a long time but it's also hard to remember how to get from place to place. I can tell they're going for a Daggerfall/Morrowind style, but even those games had ""fast travel"" in the way of riding animals.

There's a lot of good gameplay and ideas here, and it's definitely a creative and one-of-a-kind game, but personally the one thing that makes me drop games the quickest is when I feel like they *don't respect my time.*

Maybe in a future revision they can fix some of these issues.

That's fine the first ten times, but past that I'm just annoyed. Eventually I hit the point where I looked some things up so I could make more progress. And if I did that because the game felt exhausting to explore, I may as well just pack it up. So I did.  
  
**Arctic Eggs** - A weirdo game in which you cook eggs (and cigarettes, cans of tuna, and whatever else) at some strange Arctic base. Kinda goofy, lots of weird world building, but not the most compelling gameplay.  
  
**Lorelei and the Laser Eyes** - A neat puzzle game with very stylish art and great vibes. Lots of really nice QoL features (you have a photographic memory that allows you to view basically all the documents and whatnot you find from the status menu) but still has you writing all sorts of weird notes down. Difficulty has felt solid, some stuff feels tricky but not hair pullingly tricky. The core mystery of the game feels quite compelling. I will say that a back button for menus would be a bit of a godsend. As far as puzzles go, I find Lorelei and the Laser Eyes to be much more satisfying than Animal Well.",0.0379036735895811,0.0089560747146606,0.499714642763138,0.984572172164917,0,1

post_10,post_10_16,"**Animal Well**

Animal Well is like an ogre -- it has layers. The first layer is a cute animal-themed Metroidvania, and it's among the best I've ever played. The different tools you find to help you explore new areas and solve new puzzles are incredibly creative and have multiple wildly different uses that the game subtly guides you to discover organically. Of all the tools in the game, I only successfully predicted what *one* would be in advance. The others were all delightful surprises. 10/10 would recommend to anyone and everyone who will listen.

The second layer is a literal easter egg hunt. This layer starts out really fun and joyful, but collapses into a slog near the end when you've just got 3-5 left and the game is completely unwilling to provide any guidance on where to look, so you just have to wander aimlessly and pray. I would give this layer a 7/10, but it could be easily elevated to a 9/10 if the developer took a cue from Tunic's endgame and offered a way to ask the game for a vague hint if you're barking up the wrong tree. As it stands, I would recommend anyone who gets down to their last 2-3 eggs just look up their general locations in [a guide like this one](https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/animal-well-eggs-locations) to save yourself hours of frustration.

The third layer and beyond consists of increasingly obscure Fez bullshit that I'm happy to watch other people solve online.

**Honkai Star Rail**

Ah, the duality of gacha. When Star Rail is just being a JRPG, it's everything I'm looking for. It's got high production values, a cool setting, minigames, and fun background characters and environmental interactions to find with surprisingly engaging writing.

And then once in a while it will slap you across the face with a reminder that it's a live service gacha game with all the obligatory trappings and it's time to pay the piper by leveling up your characters again, using a million different currencies that you have to farm using time-gated energy mechanics, and all of the joy drains out of it until you're caught up again.

There are the bones of a fun combat system here, but in practice the amount of time you spend actually engaging with it is negligible. The heavily vertical nature of progression means that you're almost never in the tiny band of the difficulty spectrum where your decisions matter. In practice, most fights are either so trivial you can let the AI autobattle it out while you browse Reddit on another monitor, or straight up impossible without more grinding.

At the end of the day, I recognize that games like Star Rail or Genshin, with their scope and update cadence, would not be created under any other business model, so I groan about it but ultimately tolerate it.",0.136304732559205,0.0127590298652648,0.499686747789383,0.999598234891892,0,0
post_10,post_10_17,"**Finishing up Pokémon shining Pearl!** I mentioned I wasn’t sure what was the better game between it and platinum and might not know until after beating it a few more times. I’m starting to form an idea already though. Someone mentioned that Platium was a straight shot and Brillant Diamond and Shinning Pearl just let players do what they like. I think that’s a really good way of putting it. 

There’s also the fact that other things such as a guide also mentioning that Platinum does not compensate for battles being moved around very well. Most notably, there was a boss that was a little bit past the halfway point in Diamond/Pearl and was moved to the earlygame in Platinum, even though the team still partially acted like they were at the original point. There was also a boss that pretty much could softlock a player due to being moved to a different area where the player could not heal or leave easily and given an upgraded team; the softlock never happened to me, but there were sometimes it got close and it very well could have. 

And there’s no ignoring that 2/3 of the Pokémon are unattainable without peripherals (some of which don’t even exist anymore) and if you don’t have the resources to play at a competitive level, a lot of the post game is blocked off. Pokémon brilliant diamond and shining pearl do not have that issue and still have a fairly lengthy post game (even though a lot of it was optional). There was even a small competitive area there for those that still want to partake, even though it’s nowhere near the size of Platinum.

So is Platinum the more polished game? Yes. Does Platinum have better teams in the main story? Yes. Is it more restrictive and does it run into post game issues because of the changes? Also yes. Does this mean it’s the better game regardless? Not necessarily. I think it’s pretty telling that when I play Platinum, I was pretty frustrated at some point and did not touch it for a while after completing it. I eventually went for 100% run that failed (mainly because I lost the game and had to restart, but I was also having trouble getting the last few things), a few challenge runs that also failed, a few successful runs for gaming events I was in, and a bit of transferring things up. But without the communities and transfer, I doubt I would’ve played it more than once. In contrast, I am playing Shinning Pearl on a challenge run, really enjoying it without any of the frustration, and I’m already planning to jump straight into another one, although I’m also also planning to take a break once I get some materials early in the game that would otherwise be hard to find (so I basically can continue from wherever I want and not get burned out). 

It’s worth noting I wasn’t too impressed with Brilliant Diamond when it first came out, but I also had access to a modified version of platinum that was able to get everything without peripherals. So the game got overpowered by something that really shouldn’t have existed in the first place. It remains to be seen how the game compares playing the two as intended, but there’s a chance that might take the upper hand.

Right now I’m focusing on the post game with flying types only. I’m just completing the last few areas, and then I’ll head back to the Elite Four rematchs. I do know I want to do the platinum teams, and I want to do one run for every type. However, I’m sure if anyone will get to the final version that happens when you beat the souped up teams 20 times. I had a team that did in brilliant diamond, but it was really hard because the player usually doesn’t get those levels. 

And this team already had some trouble with the Elite Four to begin with even though I cleared it the first time so I don’t think they would be ready. I do eventually want to try out different teams against those in a 100% run, but that wouldn’t be for a while. I’m planning on starting a steel type run after and doing the initials setup at least, but I’ll probably switch to a different game after that just prevent burnout.

As for my final thoughts in the game, it’s very solid, and I have a greater respect now that Scarlet and Violet went a completely different direction (still good, but different). I still wish it could’ve included most of the platinum content (the battle frontier might’ve been a bit much depending on the audience for that, but everything else seemed like it could’ve been doable) alongside the quality of life changes. It would’ve been interesting to see how platinum stacks up with the quality of life changes and if my opinion would’ve changed, but will never know that now. 

I would’ve also liked to see something from Pokémon Legends Arceus in reverse. Maybe someone from those games travels to the present time and decides to stay there. or all of the characters, seeing as they’ll never be seen again otherwise. but sadly, that doesn’t happen, even though Pokémon Masters had an event that sort of did this. It’s a bit frustrating because Legends had a lot of references to this game, but the reverse didn’t happen and I felt like there wasn’t really a conclusive ending for any of the characters as a result. A bit more about Cyrus and what he was like after the events of the game would’ve also been nice, even though the battle tower does this a little little bit if the player gets lucky and matches. But this also didn’t happen.

Overall, it kind of falls in line with the other remakes because they didn’t include a lot of contents from the third versions. Heartgold and Soulsilver just remade events from the ground up but a lot of it was based off of the original games, Pokémon yellow got a reimaging combined with Pokémon Go and the original GBA remakes didn’t include anything from yellow at all, ORAS added some new content but didn’t include any emerald content, including shortening some things that were there (to the point where I prefer emerald over it), and this remake was deliberately faithful as kind of a side project for the team. a lot of it is par for the course, and it’s still a good game, maybe one of my top three Pokémon games, but I can’t help wanting what might’ve been. I believe it’s because platinum added a lot of things to the story and completely redid areas, whereas the other third games did not for the most part, but I can’t say for sure.

If I get to the point where I’m ready to take a break, i’m just going to try and finish up everything I can in **Super Mario brothers wonder.** it would involve doing two Yoshi runs back to back if I went straight through, but I feel like I’m close to being ready for that. I can’t do anything beyond Yoshi, so it’s going to the point where there’s not too much more new content for me to explore. I’m OK with that and I’m probably going to up with about 30 hours, which is pretty long for a standard Mario game. And there’s a lot of footage where I can watch things I missed. It would’ve been nice to try and get get the content I hadn’t been able to, but I still have a blast with what I could do!",0.0274385592487253,0.0103623867034912,0.499744713306427,0.0062050819396972,0,1
post_10,post_10_18,"[Last time](https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ckn1nu/weekly_rgames_discussion_what_have_you_been/l2pg4uu/)

**Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3** (PC) - The original one. I beat it on regular difficulty in a little over 5 hours. It's better than the second one but it's still quite a silly game.

The big issue is this - Modern Warfare 3 calls back to many previous levels in the Modern Warfare series but misses what made the original ones so interesting. There are two levels that are very similar to All Ghillied Up, but they don't quite hit the same highs as that one did. The answer for why, I think, is relatively simple - in All Ghillied Up, you can keep stealth going until the end of the level without ever breaking cover. With the stealth missions in this game, you always end in a massive firefight no matter what you do. It doesn't make the enemy feel as threatening if you know you're just going to successfully shoot your way out in 10 minutes or so.

This isn't an isolated incident - Iron Lady is another big offender. This mission switches viewpoints between the 'ground' and the viewpoint that was in 'Death From Above', but all of the dark satire and bleakness of that level has now been replaced with playing the scenario completely straight. It's such a strange level - at the end, there's a landmark that's on the verge of toppling over and I thought that the landmark would stay slanted as a cheesy kind of 'we're beaten down but there's still hope' sign but instead, it just topples over with no-one commenting on it. It's literally like a scene from Team America: World Police. 'Down the Rabbit Hole' is also like a slightly worse version of 'No Fighting in the War Room'. At least 'Turbulence' arguably improves a bit on 'Mile High Club'.

Note that I've not yet mentioned the plot of the game. It does a decent job of rounding off the 'Modern Warfare' story, as absolutely insane as it is. We've gone from isolated-ish incursions in Modern Warfare 1 to the end of a Russian invasion of the USA and the beginning of a Russian invasion of literally all of Europe in Modern Warfare 3. To bridge the series, there's several 'scenes from previous games from a different perspective' that feel horrifically crowbarred in and end up retrospectively cheapening parts of the prior story. Makarov doesn't have a whole load of depth to him and the bonds between the main protagonists don't feel as strong as they could. They have a 'remember the new guy' character too which doesn't totally work. To balance this, there's the traditional voiceless player character who's part of the US army whose campaign is sort of interesting if a bit standard. Some of the set pieces are, admittedly, quite cool though with an impressive level of polish and detail.

In terms of the level design, I think I enjoyed it more than Modern Warfare 2. It's a globetrotting adventure which means there's more variety and some of the capital cities that I've been to have been fairly faithfully recreated (at least in tone if not necessarily in geography). One downside is I feel like there's far more enemies with rocket launchers this time around, which I suppose is in keeping with the nutty tone of the overall game. The gimmicks are fairly interesting, like the robot you can control, and I was shocked that some of them came back in later levels (like the night vision).

I feel as though it's better than Modern Warfare 2 on the basis of spectacle alone but it's far, far below the original Modern Warfare. Parts of this are risible and it's perhaps a good thing that the trilogy is now over - things couldn't get much more mad in a Modern Warfare 4 (actually, if the last level in MW3 is any indication, maybe they could). Despite this I'm looking forward to Black Ops 2 - I feel as though the original mostly did a good job at walking the line between pulp and seriousness with some satirical elements thrown in so I'm interested to see how that one takes it further.

The weapon mechanics are a bit of change from the series prior where you're punished for getting hit with a meter that once charged up will substantially increase your move combo length that's charged by every attack but goes down whenever you get hit. It's a weird change that doesn't work so well but if you can fill it up it is satisfying to then obliterate everything in your path with OP combos. Story wise I believe this is chronologically the first game with Kratos being tormented by some beings known as the furies with one of them actually helping Kratos out betraying the rest.

I didn't enjoy it as much as the first game.  I felt like a lot of the characters kept hammering away at the same debate points over and over.

The outdoor environments can be pretty big.  Sometimes this can mean walking several minutes to get to a puzzle that you solve in 15 seconds.

I didn't try any of the gold door puzzles.  After completing 120+ puzzles, I just wanted the game to end.


**Stellar Blade**


I really enjoyed this.  It's most similar to Nier: Automata, but with better combat.  


I've seen lots of complaints about the story and voice acting.  The story is fine for a video game.  I think the voice acting is fine from a performance standpoint.  Some of the dialogue is a bit wordy.  Characters in conversations are hand animated in a mediocre matter.  That would be fine in a game like Dark Souls that doesn't zoom in on talking NPCs, but here it just looks bad.


Playing NG+ can get annoying because it seems to be somewhat random on whether or not you can skip a cutscene.  Some story segments might be divided up into 4 consecutive parts, but you'd only be able to skip 2 of them.

Certain parts have too much dialogue.  Talking to a merchant has 4 different voicelines every time you talk to them.  Interacting with the quest board has 2 voicelines before the menu pops up.

I greatly enjoyed the first Darksiders game. It was a fun, if a little flawed, mix of Zelda and Greek-era God of War. As a series however, Darksiders takes some real swings and pivots. Darksiders II apparently focuses more on open world areas with the addition of a loot mechanic, while Darksiders III seems to be a Metroidvania game with combat based on the Soulsborne format. Genesis is no different, instead shaking things into an isometric twin-stick shooter dungeon crawler hybrid. However I'm not meshing with this one as well. The moment to moment writing takes a nosedive thanks to focus on Strife's marvelesque one-liners, and the movement speed is a little too slow for my liking. Two hours in and I'm not all that impressed. Perhaps if I had a co-op partner it might go a little faster, but I think this one will be a skip.

post_10,post_10_26,"**Animal Well**

Just rolled credits and did some post game. Feel like it got kind of…hard to figure out quickly after that. I’m 90% sure I just don’t have what I need or I’m not looking in the right places, but I think I’m the kind of gamer that likes a little hand holding as opposed to “you’ll figure it out” or wait til you stumble upon it approach. Glad this exists for those on the opposite side of that spectrum.

I fucking adored Fez and did a ton of post game. But I played that alongside friends, where the discovery and discussing theories and solutions was a huge push for me. Wish I had that here.

Incredible art style, atmosphere and gameplay. Highly recommend.

**Crow Country**

Conflicted on this one. Had a good time, but, in an opposite opinion from above, puzzle solutions felt very sponges to you. I loved the presentation of the game, but felt the execution left a bit to be desired. Enjoyed the story, though! In hindsight, would’ve waited for a sale. $15 feels like a sweet spot here, but I think most folks who are fans of the genre would be happy to plop down $25. 

**Star Wars: Jedi Survivor**

Just started this. Struggling with the controls and combat A LOT. I don’t know why. Maybe I need to bump difficulty down…so far, struggling to pick it back up.

**Dead Cells / Slay The Spire**

Finding myself loading these both up to do a run once a day right now, despite having had more than my fill of these two many years ago. Dead Cells has had an incredible amount of updates since, so it’s been fun to see some of those. Need to buy the DLC! It’s so damn good.

Struggling to beat Slay the Spire with the Ironclad and the Defect (talking all the way to the heart). Came close with the Defect twice (heart down to less than 10 HP - needed to take a long break after losing those two, ha), but just can’t find a good groove with the Ironclad. Either not doing enough damage or not having enough block. Tried exhaust strats, strength strats, a combo of the two…just can’t find a good groove. Has always been my least favorite character to play and my most recent playtime cements that.

Man, Dead Cells is such a phenomenal game. Have I mentioned that?",0.294122598103266,0.011895477771759,0.497990667819977,0.963941961526871,0,1

Love the game but as people mention, Tartarus is a slog. Still isn’t as bad as something like Tactics Ogre POTD

Am pleasantly surprised the music is pretty damn good ( 5>3>4 ). As the characters are more grounded and serious than something like Yusuke (p5) story or the steamy bathhouse in (p4). That said though, it does give more variety in dungeons and story than just one Tartarus dungeon

One thing though that I didn’t like is how tight the social links are.

Genuinely terrible name aside, it's been the only game I've played for the past few weeks. It's incredibly frustrating at times but the game is just a lot of fun. I really wish they put some more effort into it though, it's buggy as hell. I tried opening Ultimate Team mode just to open the stupid pack that everyone got for free and the game wouldn't load it properly so I just gave up and went back to Manager Career. It's a great game mode but it's also buggy. It gives you quick sim option to skip less important fixtures but your players become unhappy if you use it. I have 2 strikers that each play 45 minutes every game to keep them both rested and one of them (crucial player) is very happy with his game time while the other (rotation player) is unhappy with his game time, even though they literally play the exact same amount. Transfers are also a bit annoying because the tiniest differences in 2 prices can actually fuck over your transfer. A club will turn down 30mil offer and ask for like 20% sell-on clause but remove the clause and add another 50-100k onto that and they're happy. The board will give you 3 seasons to sign 2 youth players to the first team and play them in 10 games but will complain you haven't done so already after 1 season.

It’s such an immersive, fully-realized setting with some of the most compelling worldbuilding I’ve come across in the medium. 

The gameplay is fun and varied, and the skill tree lets you go in so many different directions. For my first play through I did tend to go for a more generic shooter style play through but I’m adding a bunch of skills and implants where I’m slow-motion running around the battlefield headshotting everyone, and then dashing up close to slice ‘em up with Mantis blades. It’s satisfying as hell. 

And on an LG OLED the game looks absolutely jaw-dropping. I love just riding my bike around the city taking the sights in.

Think I might be stuck? Not sure yet I need to do some poking around the edges of areas I have been already to make sure I didn't miss anything or puzzles that I may be able to solve now with new equipment. Lovely game though, the vibes are immaculate, the puzzle solving is engaging, and I haven't played something in this genre for a while (closest thing would be probably be Metroid Dread when that came out). So far I'd give it a 7.5/10, although based on reviews I'm sure that number will go up by the time I finish.

Oh, also I have about 25 eggs I think.!<

Anyways, not quite at the point where I need to ask for help or look up answers yet but might be soon if I can't find any new avenues to explore. 

**The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles** 

Big fan of the OG Ace Attorney games and replayed the collection a couple years ago on Switch (I haven't played the Apollo Justice games or the other 3DS ones). I really, really love the setting and characters far in this game. I've seen all the rave reviews for this duology and I can see why. I believe I'm on the beginning of 4th case? The one with the stabbing in the street. 

I think this game starts off a bit slow for me, although I understand I need to get to know these characters and it needs to set up the overarching narrative connecting each of these cases. I just think it over-tutorialized some things but I also know this could potentially be someone's first AA game so I get it. I was finally excited to see the jury system finally come into play in the third case, and see the ""corrections"" feature in the second case.

 Anyways, can't wait to see where the story goes from here. The 3D animations really brings these characters more to life and uplifts the tone and humor in the franchise that makes it work so well for me and so many others. 

**Pokemon Unbound**

I'll start off by saying my love for Pokemon has waned hard as I've gotten older and the franchise not changing much. I'm not one of those angry reactionary redditors that bitches on the Pokemon sub about how Game Freak has ruined everything, but I'm simply just not interested in spending money on the newer games that seem relatively hollow imo. I understand it's a franchise marketed for children. That being said, I beat Pokemon White around January, that being the first mainline game I've beaten probably since Gen V originally came out (I did complete a nuzlocke of Alpha Sapphire a few years ago and hand a great time, I played Sun and dropped it after a few islands, and I got six or 7 badges through Shield and dropped it). All that to preface I'm really liking Unbound!!

The Pokemon in the starting areas are nicely varied (e.g. one route being all 'mons that evolve through friendship), the GBA pixel art always will be my favorite so that's really hitting for me, but most of all the QOL improvements are what make this game stand out to me. I know people love the narrative for this game and I'm interested in it right now but it's not blowing me away or anything (I'm only a little past the first badge), but really it's the gameplay that is pushing me forward so far. The narrative beat I just had is a great example- I'm in a volcano chasing the baddies down and halfway through I get a tagalong buddy. Makes for fun double battles and he heals my party *after every encounter*. Inventory management and running back and forth is not what makes Pokemon fun, so having a partner there to change up the battles for a while and not making random encounters annoying for me while I'm balls deep in a volcano is great! Smaller things like that, the difficulty settings it sets up for you, etc., all make for a smoother experience that is a breathe of fresh air and is enough to keep me going. Also, I found and caught a shiny Caterpie (1/4096 odds), so I'm riding that high from yesterday still. 

Also shoutout to Delta being on iOS now. I'm never a phone gamer outside of doing Wordle, Connections, and Knotwords occasionally, but this might change that. Also, anyone know if I could set up a cross-save feature on my PC? Doubt it, but might as well ask.

--------
Wrapped up my time with this game on Saturday evening. I enjoyed it immensely, though I found the conclusion of Layer 3 to be rather underwhelming. I wasn't planning on even attempting Layer 4, so I looked that up afterward.

For those who don't know, the game has four ""layers"" of puzzles. The first layer is puzzles presented as puzzles, the second layer is the ""100%"" collectible stuff, third layer is more observation-dependent puzzling, and fourth layer is a mixed bag of things that are very obtuse and not really meant to be found.

Anyway, layers 1 and 2 are fantastic and I found them to be extremely satisfying. The ending of layer 1 is probably the peak of the game, in terms of cinematic elements/immediate rewards, but layer 2 also has a nice conclusion and some fun exploration. There should probably be a radar or something to help you with wrapping up your egg hunt, once you hit a certain threshold, but if you have been consistently observant throughout the game, and maybe taking some notes, it's really not all too bad. The one egg I was missing ended up being overlooked because I forgot to note a location that very overtly signaled it had an egg in it. The room for those curious: >!Turtle room.!<

Entering layer 3, I had found over half of the ""collectibles"" in it already, and the cleanup after that was rough. By the time I had 2 left, I made sure to get some ""general area"" hints: >!the one where you have to move the vines and the crows.!< One I just needed progressively more overt hints because the solution was just wild: >!floor is lava!<

After figuring out the final puzzle, I also had some help with >!the entry method for the code.!< I was definitely at the point where I was ready to be done lol

The conclusion after that ended up being underwhelming, imo, >!and while there's probably some use for what you're given, I just didn't imagine the game would be able to make me feel like spending more time with it would be worthwhile.!<

If you enjoyed layers 1 and 2, maybe take a shot at layer 3, but don't expect a ton more from the game. I *would* recommend trying a little speedrunning though; seems like the routing can get wild.

post_10,post_10_46,"**Kingdom Come Deliverance (PC)**

To get the negatives out of the way, there’s some jank, some bugs, and some restriction of player agency/freedom: Limited saves, framerate dropping to 10-15 fps in certain cutscenes, bad collision detection with arrows, getting stuck on terrain, quests being unfinishable, crashes. I quickly modded save-anywhere/anytime, infinite carry weight, ranged crosshair, and a few others; put in some custom .cfg settings; and switched to a less ambitious UV/OC profile.

And I also pretty quickly decided to focus on the main campaign. There really isn’t enough depth or variety in the exploration, economy, or mechanics to support much sidequesting. This has proven to be a wise choice, as I’ve noticeably felt more eager to play.

Initially, I loaded this up because of how much praise I read from players, in the announcement threads of the sequel: “best RPG I’ve ever played” and such. Alas, I don’t feel the same way and would expect that to be a fairly common response. It’s a solid thumbs up, 7/10 or 8/10.

I could add more criticism, but I’d rather focus on the positives: the game has a clear vision and executes on it faithfully. This is EXACTLY what I want from the gaming industry, even though that means not every game is going to be for me.

Kingdom Come is a historical RPG, faithful to the time period. You play as Henry, a blacksmith’s son who can’t fight for shit - there’s a hilarious early cutscene of Henry testing out a new sword and looking like a fool. He can’t even read, to start, and hurts himself when he first shoots a bow.

But something happens that liberates Henry from the mundane course his life was taking and motivates him to learn these skills. I knew as much going in, but I did not expect how much of a detective Henry ends up becoming. The main quest stuff I’m doing now is a lot of “Investigate this attack on a nearby village - who, why, and where did they go after” or “Go find the who and how of this counterfeit currency” or “Infiltrate this monastery.” There’s a definite Count of Monte Cristo vibe / inspiration here, with the revenge story, Henry’s humble origins, and the investigative element.

There’s just some really cool moments, like when you read a monk’s medicine book in order to diagnose a recent outbreak. It’s obviously not modern medicine (‘balancing the humours’ and all that) - yet it’s clearly a serious and even useful text. It’s that medieval authenticity that gives KCD its shine. For better AND worse. I mentioned that infiltration of a monastery earlier, and it’s a brilliant sequence that aims to truly capture the day-to-day of being a monk, including praying for HOURS straight, which - no surprise - is TEDIOUS, even in a video game in which you can instantly ‘wait’ 2 hours.

I also think the combat is amazing. I’ve read a TON of complaints about it and y’know it frustrates the hell out of me sometimes too. But it’s made me appreciate just how difficult it is to combine RPG stats with skill-based combat. Because of various mechanics, you quickly realize to be successful that you need to A) be a mongolian horse archer or B) learn how to use master strikes and fight defensively to create an opening that you then punish into. Movement and terrain positioning is also absolutely essential for multi-opponent combat. The enemies are incredibly aggressive and will encircle and outflank you if you don’t fight at choke points or keep moving.

All said, I’m happy this game was made and was successful enough to warrant a sequel, even if I’ll be taking a ‘wait and see’ approach to that sequel. It’s just that historical settings are wasted on me. Give me giant mushroom trees or a demi-god with a dragon-head for an arm or a gryphon so I can jump on its back and stab it repeatedly in the head.

As a final note, this was my first game played on my new monitor (curved ultrawide, upgraded from 1440p flat), and it’s been an immersive joy. On my flat screen, I was used to having the whole view within my primary vision, but with the ultrawide, the edges start entering peripheral vision territory. It helps create a sense of being IN the world, rather than staring AT the world. It’s not going to make the difference between liking or hating a game - or even liking or loving a game - but if a gamer looking to upgrade monitors asked my advice, I would definitely advocate for curved UW.",0.126113528824023,0.0136480331420898,0.499738305807114,0.827504932880402,0,1

post_10,post_10_51,"Playing **Yakuza 5** and **GOD HAND** for the first time. Both great games so far, but a bad combo as GOD HAND can't help but highlight how bad Yakuza 5's combat is.

I remember Woolie talking about some fighting game and exasperatedly exclaiming that something was ""unsafe on hit,"" meaning if you successfully landed it, you would be open to counter attack. Most Yakuza games are Woolie repeatedly exclaiming ""UNSAFE! ON HIT!"" over and over. It's a real shame too as I can't help but feel like they would be more than late blooming cult hits (which I love) if they had even pretty good combat.

The PSP games developed by the same folks who made the Def Jam games got ok combat right, but they were JP only so they don't get the discourse they deserve. I hear Lost Judgment is a big budget game that finally gets it right, but they canceled the series, and I've still got a ton of work to do on my Yakuza play though before I get there myself.

post_10,post_10_52,"Last week, I finished the main game playthrough of **Horizon Forbidden West on PC**.  Where Horizon Zero Dawn is one of my all time favorite games, Forbidden West for me at least, is a forgettable bloated and bland sequel.   I put close to 130 hours in, did the whole main story, all side quests, almost all upgrade jobs, errands, etc.  The gameplay, which is pretty decent, was completely ruined by a completely cringe script, horrific voice acting, unbearable facial expressions by most of the games characters, and the overall tone of the game.   Most of the time when you start a mission or conversation, it felt like a social media therapy session filled with modern tortured cartoon like internet memes.  So much of the writing is simply insufferable.   Where Aloy felt like a one woman wrecking ball in the first game, in the second game she feels like she's about to start crying, hugging or punching people all the time.   Just awful....    I imagine the writers actually thought they were gonna teach us all something about the world......

On the good side, the world/map is amazing, ruins are better than ever, and we get to see Lance Reddick again as Sylens (one of my favorite actors of all time  RIP).  The climbing mechanic is horrific, the skill trees (if you can call it that), are convoluted and make no real sense, and the weapons are a mess compared to the first game.  The machines and machine killing is great again, and the PC port is stable and well done.   I tried to start the DLC Burning Shores, but just could not go on.  I had my fill of the whole thing.....

I then, like many people, watched the Fallout TV show, and then felt the urge to play those games again.   I decided this time to replay **Fallout 4**, which I had (according to Steam) about 450 hours in from many years ago.  I have about 1000 hours in Fallout 76, which I enjoyed over many years of its maturation, and about the same in Fallout 3 and New Vegas.

I forgot most of Fallout 4, and as I'm now about 20 hours in, Its amazing what a deep and giant world it is.  There's simply so much to find, explore, and do, and I actually barely remember any of it.....   So far, its been great.  Loaded a couple of mods (the reload time mod is a must), but am playing mostly vanilla for this playthrough.

post_10,post_10_56,"**World of Warcraft - Panderia Remix**

Came out Thursday and been playing it off/on.  I started in Legion so questing through all the zones has been pretty fun since I'm experiencing the stories for the first time.

Love that transmog, repairing, etc. is free, each quests gives a chest for rewards, and flying is unlocked from the start.

I am finally getting a bit bored of it, around level 40~ now, so might stick it out to get to max level then drop off, since raiding seems to be the main appeal late game and that doesn't appeal ot me in WoW anymore.

___

**League of Legends**

New split started, and with that new updates and some other stuff.  For note, I am a JG/Supp main that plays other rolls to fill as well

The good - Big fan of the ADC item rework.  Getting to crit in 4 items feels good as an ADC.  I like the new boots to get to recall to base faster as a support. 

The bad - New champ mastery system is pretty bleh in comparison to before. Not a fan of the new icons, getting mastery grades are harder, and the numbers aren't a direct translate so it's hard to feel good/bad about being a high mastery champ.  Additionally I had a person goal of getting mastery 7 on all champs, but that drive went away since it's not as clear what's a ""high"" and ""low"" mastery anymore.  Like 50 is just as high as 100 is just as high as 300 as is 500.

___

**FFXIV**

Back on to grind out the PvP Series.  Up to rank 17, going for 25 as usual for the cosmetics.  Just doing 1 frontlines a day, then will grind out the remainder as needed.

Works out since the new Mogtome event is out as well, so gonna get some rewards along the way.  The rework of this even to give little ""quests"" to get more mogtomes was great and really helps give me some other stuff to do while I wait for Dawntrail.

I love this game so much with friends.  It's the right amount of horror, thriller, and silly.  We finally went to some ""end-game"" moons as we've always been just doing the free moons, and the planets just to get to the facilties are so cool.

post_12,post_12_3_2,"I also gave up on it. But it's a very different game than Hollow Knight. 

Here are the things I don't like about Dave the Diver:

1) It's tedious. I know some people like games with tons of different things to do. To me, it feels like a second life. I don't want to manage 1,000 things. I already have my real life for that. I'm playing a game to get away from that. Why they thought it was a good idea to include so many mechanics is beyond me. It's trying to do way too much.

2) The sandbox aspect of the game is pretty weak. The ocean world isn't that randomized. It's more or less the same underwater map every time and there's not much to get excited about in terms of what you find. At first it seems really cool and open-ended and then you realize there's nothing rare to find and the things that are rare are basically in set locations.

3) The game is way too prescriptive in when you're allowed to do things. For a game that seemingly allows you to explore, it's fairly linear. Events happen according to a preset timetable, not when you make a discovery. When a new thing does happen, there's a cutscene and a bunch of dialogue and it's suddenly more like a JRPG than an open-world adventure game. The game has an unending string of procedurally generated fetch quests, if you want them - not my idea of a good time. 

I get why some people love the game. It has some charm. It does a few things well, but it wasn't the gameplay I wanted. I was hoping for Terraria meets Pokemon in the ocean, and it's not that. It's more like 15 games crammed into one. For people who love RPGs, I imagine all of this is a lot more palatable, but for players like me who value pure gameplay and freedom above most other things, the game disappoints a bit.",0.027580488106413,0.0104244947433471,0.499720185995102,3.63588333129883e-06,0,1

post_17,post_17_2_2_1,"About a year and a half ago now, a very popular YouTuber called hbomberguy released a two hour video which was primarily a grand exposé of Tommy Tallarico and his frequent lies and exaggerations about his career accomplishments, as someone who works on audio for video games. 

Since hbomberguy released a similar and even more widely-viewed and discussed exposé about the YouTuber James Somerton, a few months ago, the Tommy Tallerico video has gained even more exposure.

And now it's become a whole meme to say that hbomberguy might make a career-ruining video about someone.

Tommy Tallerico's greatest claim to fame is now the total destruction of his career and credibility at the hands of a YouTuber previously best known for liking Transformers and Dark Souls II.

post_17,post_17_3_5,"General summary - This is a very popular video initially talking about who made the popular Roblox ""OOF"" sound - but ends up being an investigation of Tommy Tallarico, a composer that owned the studio that made that sound as well as president of Intellivision - not to mention a seemingly pathological liar.

Relevant to this topic, after becoming the president of Intellivision in 2018, he intended to release a new console, Amico, in 2020. With incredibly unfortunate timing, one of the major selling points of the console would be that it had no online play.

To fund the project, he started multiple million dollar+ crowdfundings, sometimes using incorrect and misleading info on who was still on the team. He even went on record to say that the Karma System they were marketing was just ""some shit \[they\] made up"".

I highly recommend checking out the video, because this doesn't even scratch the surface of Tommy's shenanigans.

I think if all executed correctly, this could be a hit in social centers.

There are a number of indy arcade-like games that if some front end UI rework was done to handle a public environment they could be candidates.",0.0293681836542169,0.319136798381805,0.499744832515717,0.999713718891144,0,1

I agree from a story perspective, but from a gameplay perspective it would get pretty repetitive facing only nids the whole game. 

I'd definitely prefer a different faction... always thought Necrons would be a unique faction to fight. We already fought Orks. Dark Eldar are another option.

They've fought each other extensively in the Damocles Gulf Crusade, with it ending in a stalemate because the Imperium had to go deal with the Tyranids. I imagine from a gameplay perspective it'd sort of feel like fighting the Automatons in Helldivers 2 and then going off to fight the Terminids. Tau are noted for being really annoying long-range combatants, generally trying to kill you before you can get to close-range combat where they're not as strong.

In general there's no real lore reasons that would restrict enemy types (but who knows with Games Workshop when it comes to video games and the licensing, they can sometimes get really strict with what is depicted).

Dawn of War Dark Crusade/Soulstorm basically had some kind of an excuse for fighting every other faction due to its more open-ended campaign (almost like a 4x campaign map). Even Imperial Guard fighting Space Marines or Space Marines fighting Sisters of Battle.

This [video](https://youtu.be/4WRFa5PXgGA?si=Ml8xQvqeNVfklTqE&t=3190) shows the post campaign victory text for an Imperial Guard battle against Space marines.

I hear this argument from people all the time, so I don't want to write my usual long response out. 

A major theme of 40k is there are no ""good guys"" ***by our standards*****.** It sounds nuanced, but it's an important distinction. It would be insane to argue that Drukhari aren't more blatantly evil than Tau or their Craftworld cousins. ""The Imperium is Xenophobic and bad!"". Yeah, you would be, too, if you had Genestealer cults cropping up when you *do* open up too much that lead to a Tyranid invasions and the end of an entire system.

I understand the world has nuance, but to safely pull that off can be a difficult thing when trying to win a bigger audience. Generally, people like to play the hero. It's the safer route from a storytelling perspective.

Yep.

They literally laid off staff from Insomniac Games after selling 10+ million copies of Spider-Man 2 because they found out that game cost 300+ million dollars to make and they have to find a way to develop those games cheaper. Hence reduction of staff.

I mean. Math is unforgiving. Spider-Man was made on 100 million budget and it sold 20+ million copies. Spider-Man 2 was 3x more expensive and Sony expect it to sell 20+ million copies. And game is only 10$ more expensive.

""Recently, some files in the leak revealed that Sony pressured [Insomniac Games](https://gamerant.com/tag/insomniac-games/) to make budget cuts. [According to IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-pressured-its-studios-to-make-big-cuts-amid-increasing-development-costs), Sony requested the company to remove around 50 to 75 people from the studio and recommended the teams from the upcoming *Wolverine* and *Spider-Man 3* be cut and replaced with members from *Ratchet and Clank*. Part of the reason for these layoffs was Sony’s worry about the growth of development costs at the studio. Sony was concerned that *Spider-Man 2* cost around $30 million more than its original budget, which was already $270 million""

I never said that they targeted specific people who worked on Spider-Man 2. I just said that it is insane that studio that released 3 games in 4 years (Miles Morales, Rift Apart, Spider-Man 2) was pressured to lay off it's staff.

So pretending like there is not problem with rising development costs in AAA industry is just pure naivity.

This sub tends to have a vision of gaming that implies better graphics mean games take longer to develop and are primarily responsible for ballooning costs, and that smaller, worse looking games will come and save us. That's not always true.

I mean, take Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, and Starfield, for instance. These games have graphical fidelity reminiscent of the style and quality of the early to mid PS4 era, yet they took 5, 6, and over 7 years to develop, respectively. Comparatively, God of War: Ragnarok and Horizon: Forbidden West each took 4 years, while Spider-Man 2 took 5.

[According to the Insomniac leaks](https://i.imgur.com/6KliGOi.jpeg), if the studio eliminated its entire in-house animation budget for Spider-Man 2, it would save them 14% of the total costs, or $34.8 million; this is less than the overall cost of the art team, and still doesn't address the issue of people finding the gameplay too repetitive and uninspired.

... that's the point. The argument being made here is that the better value proposition for gamers is to redirect the costs spent on prettier graphics into creating more interesting gameplay. If these games already cost 200-300 million, trading graphical evolution for innovative design risks won't make them cheaper. Studios aren't actually reducing the overall development time or cost by making less visually impressive games if the better-looking games take just as long or sometimes even shorter to develop than the simpler ones.

Maybe I was not clear: I said that programmer/devs headcounts don't scale as infinitely as art/animation... but they still scale lol, the point is that you can come up with an hypothetical ""Elden Ring-efied GoW Ragnarock"" (with slightly more designers and many less artists)  and that one will still be cheaper (give me some rope here: I know that Elden Ring's scope and success is based on years of From Software expertise and processes.) than Glossy/Graphical impressive Ragnarock. I have to put an asterisks here: these ""conversions"" are not free and are based on years of experience and setup: Elden Ring was built on years of retained expertise on Dark Souls,  BG3 was built on years of Divinity expertise, this is not like flipping a switch.

One last point

That's the point. A game half as visually impressive to look at, doesn't necessarily cost and take half as much to make. The argument isn't that the process of reducing costs is as simple as adjusting the ratio of programmers to artists. The argument is that simply cutting costs on animation and art isn't an exit strategy from 200 - 300 million dollar games.

Elden Ring likely costs less than that, sure, but the original point is that intense graphical evolution impacts a negative ROI; I tend to think you're overestimating the extent of that. $34.8 million on animation isn't that far off from Insomniac's [$35.0 million marketing spend](https://i.imgur.com/lR9nbTH.png). Arguing that graphics is the sole culprit for ballooning budgets is like arguing that their marketing budget alone should have crippled their returns.

>I take issue with the use of ""visuals"": visuals is a combination of graphics + art direction: you can do less with more and you can explore plenty of ways of making visually appealing games without the latest RTXs and shit.

They could, but why would we want them to, is the point. The most often repeated reasons on this are a) They take too long to make.  b) They cost too much, and that's not sustainable. c) They should divert their efforts away from graphics to better gameplay; reducing graphics substantially solves none of these presumed issues.

In reality, gamers want less emphasis on pretty graphics and more focus on engaging gameplay as a better value proposition for their time and money. If the result isn't that, arguing that studios should do less with more without benefiting the consumer in return is encouraging the studios to make a $35.0 million profit with nothing in exchange.

We will have to disagree I guess. I would to just note one thing: basing your analysis on spreadsheet man-hours has a non irrelevant flaw: graphical evolution (a wide net term I purposefully used) has a compounding effect: suddenly, you have to update the engine, integrate a new physics middleware or doing X amount of things on the programming side (which are expensive). Graphical evolution doesn't mean just bespoke/adhoc animation capture or throwaway texture, it means also having to update both tech stack and tech pipelines, it means that every peak of upgrade you do has to uplift also physics, sound... you cannot have one peak aspect of graphics and ignore the rest, it all has to match. Back to Elden Ring: From Software has been very thrifty with their tech upgrades and it shows in their games: Elden Ring wouldn't have been done at that scale and scope if From didn't purposefully keep a tight and constant tech stack that allowed them to keep almost every bit they had since Demon Souls.

> c) They should divert their efforts away from graphics to better gameplay; reducing graphics substantially solves none of these presumed issues.

I have an example on this one: Massive Ent. had to downgrade the division 2 Dark Zone from a big 24 player area to small 12 players areas allegedly because fitting high poly char models was too much for the 8th gen. I would also argue that the ""melee combat locked in animation jail"" feeling you get from, say, Spiderman or Batman Arkham is a result of that, compared to more free form combats like Elden Ring or DMCs. Would HiFi-Rush exist if you had to fit the music aspect in awkwardly forced animations on a next gen RTX's model? I'm pretty sure Cyberpunk 2077 would have twice the quests it had if they didn't force themselves in the corner of having free form dialogues instead of relying on the shot-reverse shot dialogue way of Witcher 3, which yeah is limited but much more efficient to choreograph.

>The argument is that simply cutting costs on animation and art isn't an exit strategy from 200 - 300 million dollar games.

All said and done, I don't disagree with this point, we disagree on how much budget graphics takes but at the end of the day you are still gonna pay 200+ people 13k/month average for 5 years, that's 156 millions right there, no marketing e no contractors: there are floors under which you cannot go.... I dont have a solution for that, the only thing I can say is that players don't need to see Geralt growing a beard in real time or the animation to caress the horse's testicles in RDR2, I'd say that the market is still able to support expansive games like bg3, ER, TotK with ps4 level graphics and we have... 5 years? before they increase the prices by another tenner",0.0319931489121131,0.019397497177124,0.499744236469269,2.62260437011719e-05,0,0

I don't disagree with that, but I do disagree with the notion that an emphasis on graphics is the driving force behind this. Liz England gives a great breakdown in [""The Door Problem""](https://lizengland.com/blog/2014/04/the-door-problem/).

* Creative Director: “Yes, we definitely need doors in this game.”
* Project Manager: “I’ll put time on the schedule for people to make doors.”
* Designer: “I wrote a doc explaining what we need doors to do.”
* Concept Artist: “I made some gorgeous paintings of doors.”
* Art Director: “This third painting is exactly the style of doors we need.”
* Environment Artist: “I took this painting of a door and made it into an object in the game.”
* Animator: “I made the door open and close.”
* Sound Designer: “I made the sounds the door creates when it opens and closes.”
* Audio Engineer: “The sound of the door opening and closing will change based on where the player is and what direction they are facing.”
* Player: “I totally didn’t even notice a door there.”

The nature of game development is that complexity grows exponentially, in general. Adding any new feature means the team has to establish and optimize an entirely new pipeline, which significantly increases complexity, regardless of how visually impressive the game is.

Some features take more time to develop, so studios hire more people to expedite the process, but Spider-Man 2 and Elden Ring will take the same amount of time to get to the finish line; the former simply needs a lot more developers to do it.

>Would HiFi-Rush exist if you had to fit the music aspect in awkwardly forced animations on a next gen RTX's model?

I feel like that's a different topic altogether, because Tango Gameworks wouldn't get the budget to do that in the first place.  Only a handful of studios in the industry have both the willingness and financial capability to create these incredibly expensive games. I'd rather see Rockstar take a massive swing and potentially miss, than use their unique profits to make a worse looking game that most other developers could make.

>I dont have a solution for that, the only thing I can say is that players don't need to see Geralt growing a beard in real time or the animation to caress the horse's testicles in RDR2, I'd say that the market is still able to support expansive games like bg3, ER, TotK with ps4 level graphics and we have... 5 years? 

The financial and time investment of adding minute details is a negligible fraction of the overall cost of ""graphics"" compared to producing a single-take cinematic for example. Regardless of the game's technical complexity, developers are still being paid within the expected margin for their work.

I don't agree with factoring sound design and UI here. The argument being made is that the better value proposition for gamers is to redirect the costs spent on prettier graphics into creating more interesting gameplay, and  graphics cost too much.

My point is that even if the studio magically cut $35 million and $37.9 million from their overall costs to animation and art respectively, it isn't doing much to get them out of the 200-300 million ballpark, especially when the point of the argument is to get these studios to put those funds into better gameplay and design.",0.0264111335865118,0.439326703548431,0.499773055315018,9.71555709838867e-06,0,0

That aside, it's not really a matter of ""worse"" so much as diminishing returns, and a much narrower landscape.

Nowadays you have dev times bloated all to hell because they're chasing graphics, and the actual game at the center isn't gonna impress if it's more or less the same as the last several.

This wasn't really a problem I noticed with the PS4 because the clip they were pumping these games at and the consistency of quality didn't really leave much time or reason to complain, even if they were less diverse than previous generations. But with with PS5 the gaps are so long and just don't feel worth it for what we're getting.

post_22,post_22_1_5_2_1_1,"What I'd like to see is ""Cloud Questing"" where some cool and interesting series of quest elements are designed but not locked-in to some specific character, but exists in ""the cloud"" waiting to be assigned to an NPC depending on who you interact with and have affinity with. 

A cool ""detective"" quest like ""hired to investigate this character in their off hours because [quest giver] suspects them of something"" doesn't have to be specifically one narrative to work - hell in itself this type of quest has been done thousands of time already anyway in so many variations - the quest designers could have room to play with those variations within the same game - sit down and think of all the ways such a quest could go, and write/design them all. 

Is the quest giver their spouse? boss? faction leader? is the investigated NPC cheating, spying, stealing, gambling, have a silly hobby they're ashamed of? is the quest giver using this as a distraction to get the main character out of their way? to get the investigated NPC suspicious and distracted? Any cool idea you could have with this setting, played straight or as a twist, you could simply do and don't bother to try and make it fit somewhere - let the engine figure it out based on all the variables, attributes, traits, personality and relationships of the NPC. 

If you've raised you're affinity with Linda the shopkeeper and she has an employee, well the game can go ""Employer asks MC to investigate Employee"" route. But if you've never talked with Linda the shopkeeper and instead are a big fan of Carmel the mechanic, then maybe that's who's gonna get assigned this quest from the cloud, and since he has a spouse who already frequents the gambling parlor then here we go. This way cool settings can be re-used if the second time would have enough variation to basically make it a whole different quests, and also less chance to miss a really cool quest design idea just because you missed the specific character it's been written for. 

What the AI would do is help put this together, especially in terms of replacing variable terms in voice acting and animation. 

I wouldn't do that to that extent with main quests, but I'd certainly welcome it in, lets say a game like Bethesda's where you could hire and raise affinity with any NPC as companions.

Doubt it, as that was the worst ""takedowns"" I've ever read. If you're incapable of identifying reoccurring elements of a Marvel movie, that's your limitation.

Bully's cutscenes being shorter makes it automatically better despite having a much more primitive gameplay i guess.

Yeah it's a game but that tells me you have weird hangups about the idea of playing a game. Like a game shouldn't possibly feel like a movie at any moment even if it has a much superior gameplay. If good gameplay should be the focus, Sony games have that in spades, so bringing up Bully as a better example is weird, must be nostalgia cause its gameplay isn't a good example at all. It also has cutscenes, the only difference is it's more primitive due to **hardware limitations**, so of course they didn't have longer cutscenes. A remake of the game would look like a movie too. So would it be less of a game if it looked realistic with realistic cutscenes? That's ridiculous. That's why i can't buy any of what you are saying as anything more than nostalgia of good old games. PS2 God of War games might also look more like games due to looking primitive and shorter cutscenes, but they were really photorealistic for their time and you can still pull crazy combos in the new games.

> I don’t understand what gameplay is missing or what you even want. 

That's the beauty of pushing a medium to new boundaries. Your imagination is the limit. Death Stranding was creative and forced me to consider things I was never asked to consider, in a video game (balance, terrain, risk/reward). Spider-Man 2 was a continuation of the previous two entries. What made these AAA games cool last gen no longer excites me, because they've overtaken the entire AAA space. They've also given me additional time to reflect on their well masked issues. What I've come to realize is this entire space is pretty shallow, likely for the sake of broad-market appeal.

post_22,post_22_2_2_3_2,"I gotta agree with the other commenter here. Spider-Man 2 and Ghost of Tsushima are different flavors of the same game that Sony and Ubisoft have made for over a decade (Horizon, Assassins Creed, Far Cry, Days Gone, etc etc). The critic Yahtzee formerly of The Escapist derogatorily refers to them as ""Jimminy Cockthroat"" games due to their sameyness as a genre. They cram in as much of the mainstay systems as possible - levelling that isn't actually like an RPG because you just get everything eventually rather than making a 'build', shoehorned crafting elements to everything, half-baked stealth elements, etc. These games are like buffets - everything you can eat, all the content you could want, but none of it is special, or memorable, or stands out against everything as a whole. For me personally it's gotten so absurd that replaying the original 08 Assassins Creed felt like a gritty deconstruction rather than the very first work in the series.

God of War 2 and Last of Us 2 have issues of their own (for one they are way too long, Sony Santa Monica has been upfront that the GoW reboot was a planned trilogy condensed to 2 games due to long dev times) but largely avoid the pitfalls of being a paint-by-numbers open world cinematic survival craft-em-up video game. And just to clarify, I've actually beaten every single game I discussed in this comment (except modern Assassins Creeds which I tend to DNF due to the absurd amount of bland content). I enjoy games like these from time to time. But they're comfort food, they're not innovative or the best at anything they do.

So people just watch some YouTubers and make their opinions based on that and that's how you see some weird opinions about Sony games being like Ubisoft it's fucking funny. For some reason Zelda having a huge open world and very simple gameplay isn't similar to Ubisoft though. AAA games are blockbuster experiences, of course they aren't like indies. Even if a lot of AAA games have more features than needed, it doesn't necessarily bring down the main gameplay loop. Comparing it to Marvel is also wrong, cause going by that logic, indie action games would be like pixel art version of Marvel movies then.

Try and pin down the specific game I'm reffering to here : an open world, third-person action-adventure game, with collectibles, survival, crafting, a skill tree and optional stealth approach to combat (with a mandatory ""strip the player of all their resources"" section and making it a forced stealth part). Answer : >!fucking all of the big releases!<  
And as you mentioned, this hodgepodge of genres makes none of the elements stand out.  
Open-world? Minecraft is a true open world. Breath of the Wild and Elden Ring are good open worlds. The average open world approach is literally gating off areas from the player until the plot opens them up or artificially restricting the player via levels.  
Action-adventure? That's used for every bloody 3rd person-camera game under the sun. Wind Waker was an adventure, DMC5 is an action game, Assassin's Creed has elements of action and adventure, but since they try to both have their cake and eat it, those elements fall short.  
Survival and crafting? Surface level systems (that get used better in harder difficulties, but the majority of players will never touch those) that add in more tedium and repetition than needed. Those work in survival and crafting games, and the combination of both, because those are the meat and potatoes that get fully developed, not tacked on because ""every game does it""

It's just the same games with a different coat of paint, yet they all sell, so they must do something right.

I responded to another comment in the same chain with my favourite 3rd person (melee) action games: DMC3-5, God Hand, KH2 and MGR:R. All of these do their combat systems great justice and make it insanely fun to play to boot with some caveats like DMC4's cut Dante campaign. 

I never really thought the gameplay in GoW amazing but it had spectacle to it without ever going too cinematic (with literal cinematics in-fights to pause the gameplay). GoW 2018 in comparison was the polar opposite to me, not only was the enemy variety absolutely non-existent, the combat itself felt absolutely sluggish (and the gear system was bad addition altogether) and there were basically 2 fights in the whole game that I thought to have invoked at least some of the spirit of the old games: Hraezlyr and Baldur.

post_22,post_22_24,"Graphical fidelity was only ever a factor during the earlier days of gaming. Once PS4/Xbone came out we basically peaked. Graphics don't really LOOK any different from then. Like Red Dead 2, God of War... etc. etc. they all look amazing even by todays standards... and they were made for less powerful hardware.

There's not much juice left to squeeze out of that orange. I think when everybody started going insane over Ray-Tracing was the clue that graphics were going to just look like they do and all we can do is adjust things like lighting now. Smaller more detailed graphical adjustments to try and reach just a liiiiiittle further into the cookie jar for some crumbs.

It's gotten to a point where the only things people really want anymore from games is higher framerates, and resolutions... and honestly 1440p, and 60fps are basically the perfection point. The higher framerates go, the less you start to notice, same with resolutions.

It's become this weird balancing act where games even on consoles now have to ship with graphical options! Which is very crazy to me lol! (I don't mind options...)

That said it's only become more and more apparent with the broadening communities online, and gaming becoming a more widely accepted hobby that all that really matters is cohesiveness. Products need to be cohesive. As long as your art-style, performance, presentation, gameplay etc. are all good and serviceable to eachother it doesn't matter.

I've been playing Paper Mario today and the graphical and audio updates are awesome... but they had to shift it down to 30fps... which is fine. Game plays great, feels great. It's an RPG after all - and the timing on the inputs is buffered so its easy to adjust to.

I think that's why Nintendo always gets such high scores across the board... they just make a cohesive game. Every choice makes sense, and it's all in service of the game as a whole. All the parts working together seamlessly. What you get ends up being a perfectly balanced sandwich. It's not trying to outdo itself in different ways during the games runtime.

If something like Animal Well can sit amongst Elden Ring, and Baldur's Gate 3... I think that says a lot about what makes a game good, and loved. Timeless even.

The discourse around games blows my mind when we established that games as a medium exist as more than just the parts they're made up of. My favorite game of all time is Shadow of the Colossus because it's a cohesive, strong experience that doesn't set out to prove itself with any ONE of it's aspects. It's just works together to provide a singular experience.

So I think as long game devs get to create art, and focus less on trying to wow everyone with the latest graphics... which has already been done (Uncharted 4 is THE video game movie...) I'll be happy.

Spend less, focus on making good... unique games.",0.0458946251807768,0.0223144888877868,0.499682039022446,0.999679714441299,0,1

Adding more depth to both the strategy layer and the tactical layer with the planet 4x map and the cover system mentioned respectively sound like great changes to me. A big problem in the first game is that with the set mission structure every campaign played out the same, and while the combat system was intriguing at first it became really monotonous and you were just going through the same motions every fight.

How prevalent a character is at higher ranks means more (Panda was one of, if not the, lowest represented characters at higher ranks), though can still be misleading.

Meta Knight was in Brawl, and was by far the worst thing to contend with in that game. Eventually, I think some chain grabbing characters got competitive with him, but only because the entire competitive ruleset was designed to prevent meta knight from cheesing games with his BS

The consensus best character in Melee is Fox, but he’s so difficult to maintain at a high level that even the best players will drop games with him. He’s a good top tier because his dominance comes from his high skill ceiling, and he has some difficult matchups against other top tiers.",0.0688493302324385,0.0202832818031311,0.499733775854111,3.09944152832031e-06,0,0

Skill applies to characters like Fox for sure (Absolutely love that matchup, even when I get my ass handed to me) Compared to facing like... I'll use IC again. It doesn't actually take all that much skill to desynch and chain grab. A day of practice to get it down, and then just learning the timing for each character.

post_28,post_28_6_7_4_1_1,"Bias just has a negative connotation, but there is absolutely bias present in game reviews specifically because of genre/playstyle. But gamers get bent out of shape if a game they like gets a bad score. If you already own the game, does the score matter all that much? 

If I reviewed a 4X game that was good, it'd get a good score. But I like 4X games. I *don't* like RTS games at all though, so if I had to review one for IGN or whatnot, I'd give it a bad score regardless of its quality as an RTS game as I just don't like them. My opinion of an RTS game really isn't very interesting, so why include it? I'd argue the only ones I should be reviewing are games like Total Warhammer because they're a combination of 4X and RTS. If you knew my preferences, you'd know I was coming at the review from the angle of someone getting their pickles in my peanut butter and just how palatable I find that. 

I've never really paid much mind to game reviews for this reason. I like reading the blurbs in the big review threads because I get a better sense of whether *I'd* like it from those quotes than I'd get from a simple 1-100 score. Those scores are just for dick-measuring.

I want a casual shooter. And CW had the weird cooldown period for killstreaks for no reason. and the pay-to-win guns of BO3 is some of the most fucked up shit. I knew a rich kid in high school who spent $3k and STILL didn’t get all the guns in BO3. That’s how bad that lootbox system was. And when they finally did add the way to earn them. It was one gun after 75 wins. Or about 750 hours (average 10 minute game) just for one gun. 

I see plenty of reasons to doubt Treyarch. Their games are tailored to the sweatiest no lifers who want small symmetrical maps, the same exact perks for the last decade, god forbid they change how Ninja works, and be as bland as possible. 

Personally I think Raven should get their own game. They knock it out of the park for whatever gamemode they are forced to come fix.

There’s a few smaller devs who also came back too. 

It’s part of why the vision for the modern IW games changed so drastically from IW(the game) and MW19 after only 3 years. Mark, Joel and the others who came back and were brought into leadership are specifically the ones pushing for the modern realism style of shooter those games are.

post_30,post_30_6_1_2_2_1_1_1_1,"I mean imo, it was all 3 devs who Killed COD. Ghosts was the beginning of the end. It felt like a rushed mess. AW introduced Lootboxes and the goofy aesthetic, and BO3 was the nail in the coffin with the god awful campaign and multiplayer. Game was “saved“ from public perception by the zombies mode which admittedly is the best in the franchise. 

But the monitzation strategies have always been the most anti-Consumer under every Treyarch game for awhile now. Not only have they had the most expensive “collectors“ editions. They introduced micro transactions in BO2, B03 introduced “COD POINTS“ and gumballs / zombies monetization, BO4 introduced the battlepass with paid skips while still having the season pass model. 

Treyarch games are quite literally the most monetized. Look at DLC guns in BO3 and BO4 and compare that to Infinite Warfare released in between those games. Why does IW have the better monetization where DLC guns were easy to unlock? Bc if it was just because of Activision, every game would have horrific monetization. But it’s only in Treyarch games.
