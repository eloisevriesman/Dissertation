post_7,post_7_0,"I absolutely don't have time to individually review the studies methodology in the Cornell link below - but I trust that the conclusions drawn are trustworthy.  


>**Overview**  
We conducted a systematic literature review of all peer-reviewed articles published in English between 1991 and June 2017 that assess the effect of gender transition on transgender well-being. We identified 55 studies that consist of primary research on this topic, of which 51 (93%) found that gender transition improves the overall well-being of transgender people, while 4 (7%) report mixed or null findings. We found no studies concluding that gender transition causes overall harm. As an added resource, we separately include 17 additional studies that consist of literature reviews and practitioner guidelines.  
**Bottom Line**  
This search found a robust international consensus in the peer-reviewed literature that gender transition, including medical treatments such as hormone therapy and surgeries, improves the overall well-being of transgender individuals. The literature also indicates that greater availability of medical and social support for gender transition contributes to better quality of life for those who identify as transgender.

I came out in 2004, and have known literally hundreds of transgender people throughout the last two decades. Every single person I have known has had their life greatly improved by access to care, and those who continued to suffer poor mental health outcomes either had additional mental health diagnoses or experienced stress not because of the treatment they received, but the challenges of navigating social stigma and concrete material challenges as a result of their identity.   


I want trans people to have access to the best possible care, and believe in clear, actionable diagnostic criteria to help avoid people receiving treatment who won't benefit from it. If you survey the words and legislature of those opposed to trans care, it becomes clearly evident that their concerns aren't rooted in an effort to create or improve best practices in order to support good outcomes for trans healthcare, it is instead rooted in an ideological position that trans people literally do not and can not exist, negating the need for treatment entirely. For example:  


[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/15/project-2025-policy-manifesto-lgbtq-rights](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/15/project-2025-policy-manifesto-lgbtq-rights)  


In the 920 page conservative policy document at the heart of the current legislative battle over access to trans healthcare ""Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise"":

>Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, sets the tone with his introduction.  
Complaining that in Biden’s America “children suffer the toxic normalisation of transgenderism with drag queens and pornography invading their school libraries”, Roberts writes: “Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualisation of children … is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to first amendment protection.”  


Note that the authors do not speak of Transgender people, they speak only of ""Transgenderism"" or ""Transgender Ideology.""   


I came out before widespread access to trans healthcare was achieved, and largely had to find treatment by paying out of pocket.

I agree that the findings seem rather positive, which is expected, however it also generated some criticism in the medical community regarding the statistical methods used. Specifically,

* Concern 1: The analysis focused on mental health treatment utilization during one specific year (i.e., 2015) rather than during a longer follow-up period, such as before and after provision of gender-affirming treatment.

>delayed puberty is considered by many to be a benign developmental variant with no long-term consequences. Thus, the mainstay of treatment is an observational, “watchful waiting” approach

It goes on to discuss how hormone treatments to kick start puberty are often done due to the psychological stress of not developing along with your peers which seems interesting considering the main use of hormone blockers is for much the same reason, psychological distress of not developing along with who you identify as your peers. 

Obviously there is a wrinkle in that puberty blockers are not included in these studies but it seems reasonable to me that until we have solid evidence there are significant detrimental outcomes to delayed puberty AND that those detrimental outcomes outweigh the alternatives of untreated gender dysphoria that people and doctors should be able to make their own choices based on the evidence available to them.",0.0280160810274032,0.078677237033844,0.499737948179245,0.0019607245922088,0,1

# 2 What you just did is called an ""appeal to authority"" fallacy. The endorsement from those organizations, frankly, does not matter. The reality is that the studies. don't, exist (which is part of why you see European health organizations changing their stance).

Basically all of their recommendations about the efficaciousness and safety of puberty blockers come from organizations like WPATH whose recommendations come from.. themselves. Those recommendations are NOT based on any robust scientific studies or consensus. It's not based off of the studies of prolific scientists in the field who have signed off. It's literally their own intentions and extrapolations based on the aforementioned studies on precocious puberty (which do exist, and do suggest that puberty blockers are safe, again, SPECIFICALLY to delay a PRECOCIOUS puberty until the onset of when an ordinary puberty would occur; NOT FOR DELAYING THE ONSET OF AN ORDINARY PUBERTY).

>i genuinely don't care, because untreated trans kids commit self harm and suicide. i would rather a trans child live with weakened bones, or whatever side effect you fear, than die by suicide before they're old enough to drive, because they were told their humanity was less important than your subjective perception of a medical study's veracity.

Again, you're being anti-science, and are jumping to conclusions based totally on emotion, not understanding that there is a chance the interventions you are championing will lead to MORE self-harm, suicides, and misery for trans youth (and subsequently, their adult selves).

I am not sure if you're aware, but there has been a report recently released that if you're ACTUALLY good-faith interested in this subject, you should definitely read: [https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/](https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/)

It actually details about the lack of evidence in many areas, and how we might identify, correct, and create effective treatments.

You don't realize this, but you could very well be the modern equivalent of people recommending lobotomies as treatments. Do you think that medical organizations should have done thorough studies on lobotomies before they were performed on 60,000 people? This could be something very similar; why are you against them doing the studies to find out?

3. and on that subject, i have read the cass report. it doesn't just argue against trans minors receiving adequate medical care; it argues that *trans adults under 25* ought be denied care as well. are you seriously trying to argue the position that transgender adults who can drive cars and vote and serve in the military should not have say over their own medical care either? if you endorse this position, you endorse trans suicide, whether you own that position or not. because i'll tell you, there are plenty of studies showing that trans people without medical support are at vastly higher risk for suicide than the ones who receive it.

we get it—you're not neutral, you're interested in preventing transgender kids from getting satisfactory medical care. by doing so, you're standing against the publicly endorsed positions of the american academy of pediatrics, american endocrine society, and american medical association. i guess this is just another ""appeal to authority""—but it's also three great reasons why i am not interested in hearing your opinion any further.

post_8,post_8_4_4_1,"I commented above, but I’d suggest a book about those books. I personally enjoy reading the original material, but if you’re looking for somewhere to start, it’s probably better than you have a better idea of their context. 

Specifically, read about social contract theory. The original US constitution was designed with a social contract in mind, but lots of thinkers had different ideas about what what the social contract was and meant for society. Once you’ve got a good grasp on what they’re talking about, you can start exploring the people that responded to Locke and Rousseau, like Marx, and understand their work in context.  

For example, and this is a way oversimplification that someone could probably nitpick to shreds (it’s been a few years), Locke believed that an individual right to property was essential to the smooth functioning of society because property rights gave way to formal means of dispute resolution (rule of laws), rather than simply violence. Marx believed that accumulation of personal property was the cause of violence in many cases. 

They both make some good points and it’s worth reading, eventually. But don’t bite off more than you can chew :) you’ve got a lot of time to read political theory and philosophy. What is more important is fostering your ability to think critically; that doesn’t mean being a devils advocate all the time, it just means that you should be thoughtful and intentional in your life. Take the world in and be a student of it. Don’t take everything you read as the truth, and learn how to recognize bullshit. Philosophy wouldn’t continue as a discipline if anyone had figured everything out. Socrates was wise because he knew that he did not know it all, and his greatest skill was demonstrating that the people who thought they did, did not.

Alright, I rambled more than I thought. But I appreciate your question because my college discovery of political philosophy and the project of solving collective problems gave my life direction when it had none.

post_8,post_8_25,"One of the most important political books I've ever read is Naomi Klein's ""The Shock Doctrine: the Rise of Disaster Capitalism"".


The book looks at the global impact of Milton Friedman and his Chicago School of Economics. Friedman's belief that essential government services can be performed better and for cheaper by the private sector has only grown in popularity since the seventies. 


Students and disciples of Milton's have been directly involved in conservative governments and military dictatorships across the globe: in South America in the '70s, including at the right hand of Pinochet; in Asia 's. Major entrance into the global markets in the '80s, in post-soviet nations during their redevelopment in the '90s, I'm finally appearing in the west in the forms of privatization, austerity measures, and tax cuts in the 2000s. 


Klein documents 40 years of cases which show Friedman's practical methods for pushing through unpopular economic decision by preparing plans in advance for times of crises so that when a moment of political unrest or economic uncertainty arises, broad sweeping changes in economic policy can be rolled out with no delay. With case studies spanning decades and continents, it is a great introduction to history of economic uncertainty in the 21st century.

Also for more modern history Pasternsks “Dr Zhivago”, while a novel, provides context to the impact of WW1, and the actual Civil War that followed the revolution.  Then Solzhenitsyn’s “Gulag Archipelago” really nails the reality of the purges.

The problem is, the list of documents notably excluded the Declarations of Causes for Secession of all 5 states that wrote them. 

Why publish a book of comprehensive documents to better understand the civil war without the documents that explain the literal reasons given for the civil war? Well, because all 5 documents mention upholding slavery as a reason, if not the main reason, for seceding. One even mentions the states anger with northern states for exercising their own states rights to not return escaped slaves, completely disproving the idea that the civil war was “about” states rights in the first place.  https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states

Interestingly, you brought up strawberries, which on this site is given as an example of something that already works.

> Routine tasks can be automated with robotics technology, reducing labor costs in the agriculture industry. For example, a single **strawberry robot harvester** has the potential to pick a 25-acre area in 3 days and replace 30 farm workers.

So I don't think it'll nearly be as catastrophic as 30-40%. To clarify, I'm not saying this is wrong or right, just that a quick search on my end indicates that we might expect efficiencies of >90% for ""easy"" to harvest fruit and >80% for more difficult ones.

And of course, I feel obligated to point out that if robots are cheaper than people and land isn't an issue, you could spend the saved money on growing more plants to make up for any losses due to damage from robots that would have been avoided by people and to provide a buffer during years of poor harvests...and so on and so forth until available farmland does become an issue.",0.0267521398423886,0.3599529266357422,0.4997191131114959,0.1457524895668029,0,0

The smaller states did not want to cede their sovereign power to the larger states. Had they not received this guarantee, they would not have joined the union. The constitutional process was also designed such that removing that guarantee would not be possible without the assent of many of the smaller states.

You might counter that the smaller states were also slave states, and that the underlying reason for the Senate was to preserve slavery. However, that’s what the three-fifths compromise was about.

post_10,post_10_1_1_2_1,"In a sense it was.  It was really force in under great contradiction to the Declaration of Independence that first and foremost established equal rights:

>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript

Unfortunately, by the time of the constitutional convention the voice of the founders that signed the Declaration of Independence was greatly diminished as it made them a high priority target during the war.  Despite being a such a self-evident truth, equal rights was left out of the US Constitution.  That contradiction wouldn’t be fixed until the Republican Party was established who were conservative beyond the Constitution, but to the founding documents as well.  This commitment can be seen in the official party political platform after the Civil War:

>We recognize the great principles laid down in the immortal Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of Democratic Government; and we hail with gladness every effort toward making these principles a living reality on every inch of American soil.

https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1868

Serously? The 3/5ths clause is evidence that white supremacy was definitely up for debate. The US Senate give 2 seats to each state, regardless of populaiton. The slave holding states were less populous. They wanted the 3/5ths clause for power in the House and 2 seats per state for power in the senate.

Suffice it to say; the two are not mutually exclusive and does not make the above a myth.

Modern examples of that design divide between reactive populism (lower house) versus slower stability (upper house) can be found in comparing the speed at which the house republicans moved into lock step with Trump’s populism, versus the senate republicans slower adoption of the same.

post_10,post_10_2,"As an American, I cannot comment on the benefits or disadvantages of a House of Lords as the concept is truly alien to me. I encourage any advocates or opponents of such a house to explain your thoughts.

Regarding Republican forms of government, the United States invented the Senate because the writers of its Constitution felt the House of Representatives disproportionately gave states with larger populations more control over the federal government. A Senate not based on population size would encourage balance of power. They also had a longer term length (6 years) than Representatives. When the Senate was first established, democratically elected State governors appointed Senators. After many, many years of quid pro quo widespread corruption, Americans began to democratically elect their Senators.

Besides passing laws, each chamber has a different set of powers. For example, the Senate is the only body who can declare war, considered an elite power reserved for the most responsible and less democratic institutions (them and the President). But the Senate cannot levy new taxes. Only the House can levy new taxes as they were definitionally supposed to be ""closest"" to the people and served only 2 year terms.

So, TL; DR: when done right, a bicameral legislature in a republican form of government encourages additional separation of powers. In theory, this continues to assist in preventing dictatorships and corruption. However, it also is one of the reasons why the United States is so conservative compared to the rest of the world and why ""progressive"" change takes such a long, long time. The UK House of Commons sometimes does sweeping changes in a way we'll never see here; their head of government is in the controlling party and unless there's a strong opposition government, they have often done whatever they want, and quickly (for better or for worse).

post_10,post_10_3,"In Canada we have an unelected Upper House (the Senate). The idea when it was first instituted was that it would be a chamber of “sober second thought”. If the senators aren’t always campaigning for reelection, the thinking goes, then they will analyze legislation dispassionately before approving it

What happened in practice was that each PM would simply fill up any vacancies (senators are appointed for an unlimited term, with mandatory retirement at 75) with members of their party to ensure that their legislation would pass mostly unhindered. This made the senate effectively useless

In 2014, Justin Trudeau, the leader of the Liberal Party kicked out all of the Liberal senators from his caucus. This meant that all the former Liberals were now independent senators. In late 2015, very shortly after becoming Prime Minister, he implemented a new process of selecting senators, where any Canadian can apply or nominate someone to become one. The nominees are then considered by an advisory board and candidates are put to the PM for appointment. In theory, this process should remove any political bias from the appointment process and lead to a more representative mix of people, professions, origins, and opinions on the senate. 

The advisory board is made up of a former chancellor of the University of Ottawa, a former mayor of a city in northern Alberta, and a former justice of the Quebec superior court. Additionally, there are advisory boards for each province which work with the federal one to help select senators (each province is entitled to a set number of senators, and one of the requirements of senatorship is that they must live in the province they represent). The resumes of the board members are quite impressive, and the members span the political spectrum

https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/independent-advisory-board-for-senate-appointments/members.html

Whether this new process has actually led to less partisanship and more political legitimacy is a matter of opinion, I suppose. 

Constitutionally, there is nothing stopping a PM from appointing whomever they wish (barring the few legal requirements for senatorship) but Canadian governance is heavily rooted in a tradition of precedent, so hopefully the procedure will continue in the future under other governments.

Emmett MacFarlane, professor of Canadian Politics and Constitution at the University of Waterloo, in his book _Constitutional Pariah_, argues that while the new process has worked well for the current government, under a future one those appointed senators may be less likely to bow to governmental objectives:

> Most of the senators appointed since 2016 appear to be people who could comfortably sit on the centre-left part of the political spectrum. If there is a lack of ideological diversity - whether it results from self-selection bias among those applying to the [appointments] process, the advisory board’s shortlisting process. or the prime minister’s final selection - it is a legitimate object of concern. And it raises the the prospect that the Senate might become obstructionist in the face of a more conservative government, something that will threaten its legitimacy if it begins defeating or unduly delaying legislation on ideological grounds.

https://emmettmacfarlane.substack.com/p/beware-predictions-of-a-senate-created

There have been many ideas over time of how to reform or abolish the Senate due to its unelected status (and therefore perceived lack of political legitimacy), but the Canadian constitution is notoriously hard to amend. The new process is likely the most straightforward way to even attempt to modify the senate under the current constitution, but it still remains to be seen whether this process will survive a future government at all",0.0247670723371088,0.0499598979949951,0.49973264336586,0.0237534940242767,0,1

post_10,post_10_4,"Honestly the best advice I can give is to read around the topic. I am not hugely widely read on the topic, but I found *Reforming the House of Lords: Lessons from Overseas* by Prof Meg Russell to be a really helpful in understanding some of the nuances of the topic - some of the circumstances have changed since the book was released (in 2000!) but the analysis is still sound and that doesn't change once the institutions change. 

https://academic.oup.com/book/4213

Below, I've tried to very narrowly answer your questions because each one of them could be a university thesis and the topic as a whole is an entire field of academic study. You'll be able to tell I'm British because I talk about the House of Lords a lot.

1. Upper houses usually (but not always) bring a different perspective to that of the lower chamber, such as through a different partisan, geographic or demographic makeup. This can be useful for widening the debate, hearing perspectives that would otherwise not have been heard, which can lead to better scrutiny of government and legislation. But depending on institutional setup and political culture, you can also get legislative gridlock if both chambers disagree. And if you think that the lower house is more likely to be acting on the behalf of the majority of voters (since that's usually the function of a lower house in a bicameral system), then it can seem fairly undemocratic  if the lower house doesn't eventually get its way.
2. There isn't a single best way of selecting members of an upper house because not all upper houses serve precisely the same function. In Germany, the Bundesrat is made up of delegates from state governments (not legislatures) and that helps make it a forum for the interests of the various states (but it's also contingent on lots of other institutional and cultural factors). In the UK, the House of Lords is mostly appointed (save for the 92 remaining hereditary members and the 25 Church of England bishops) and the chamber does a very good job of legislative scrutiny (but is again hugely contingent on institutional and cultural factors including conventions of prime ministers appointing from both their own party and the opposition parties, and the fact that constitutionally the House of Commons has primacy and so the House of Lords can't stop legislation, only delay).
3. Again, this depends on what the function of the upper chamber is. If the membership forms some kind of 'counter-representation' where they actively represent different voices (like in the Bundesrat) then they'll need to serve short-ish terms since effectively they are representing (some of) the people in a similar way to how members of the lower house are. But if they serve a scrutiny function, then serving longer and gaining more experience might be a bigger priority - the House of Lords is often praised for being a repository of expertise, and so it makes more sense to keep them around (it's not uncontroversial though - there have been some proposals to introduce a term length or an age limit (eg the Canadian Senate has an age limit of 75)).
4. Deadlocks an be prevented either by having a rule that one chamber eventually gets its way over the other, or by having a rule that you go to an election if the chambers can't agree. In the UK, if the House of Commons and House of Lords disagree and neither budge, then after one year, the Commons gets its way. In practice, the Lords will usually only oppose on the same basis once, so the 'ping pong' (yes, it's referred to as ping pong) process is almost never fully drawn out, but also the government is just less likely to put forward legislation which is likely to be voted down in the Lords, so the effects of this system can't be fully seen in the voting record. Australia meanwhile has the 'double dissolution' wherein if the chambers can't agree, it triggers an election to sort things out, followed by a joint sitting of both newly-elected chambers.
5. Personally, I like the upper chambers of the UK, Australia and Germany, although I also don't mind a unicameral proportionally elected parliament like NZ or the Nordic countries. For various reasons, I think a lot of countries miss the mark on upper chambers - eg the US, Canada, France, Italy, Poland, Romania even if they might have a lot of conceptual similarities with systems I like (eg the UK and Canada both have chambers appointed by their respective prime ministers, and the US and Australia both have directly elected politicians that ostensibly represent the interests of states), but small-ish institutional differences as well as intangibles like political culture can make a big difference.

In terms of the article you cited proposing a second chamber for NZ, it reads very much like an exercise of being all things to all people since it doesn't really lay out specifics. As an outsider, I'm sceptical of the value of an upper chamber to NZ, in large part because I'm a bit sceptical of how much additional value an elected or appointed upper chamber can provide when the lower house is already elected using PR.",0.024153818439842,0.017776072025299,0.499768853187561,0.8881526589393616,0,1

post_13,post_13_2,"So, there is definitely a level of not wanting to escalate, however, something I didn't see mentioned:
 
The US may, in the future, WANT to escalate (likely in response to something Russia does) and this gives an easy way to escalate without having to send over new equipment. 

Everything within the spoiler below is purely an example, these things have NOT happened and this shouldn't be taken as likely to happen.

>!E.g. say Russia assassinates a prominent Ukrainian figure in the UK. The US wants to retaliate, so they authorize Ukraine to make a certain number of strikes against Russian targets in some western oblasts, let's just say 20. They have to authorize each strike though. Then, Russia attacks a Ukrainian city with a nonlethal chemical weapon. To retaliate, the US allows more strikes into Russia that they still have to approve, but this time there are significantly more, say 50. The purpose of this is to convince Russia to stop doing things the US dislikes as the US doesn't really have much to leverage in terms of pressuring Russia to not do something again.!<

So, giving the Ukrainians an artificial limit allows that limit to be lifted if they ever want to retaliate for something. There's a concept called ""[The Escalation Ladder](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2022/9/1/reconstructing-the-ladder-towards-a-more-considered-model-of-escalation)"" that shows how countries tend to escalate conflict.

post_13,post_13_2_1,"I’m kind of skeptical about this take. The US is trying to give them armament in order for them to defend themselves and push out an invader. They can’t do that very well without modern arms. The rules/conditions are there to demonstrate our intentions for their use, and so that everyone on the world stage knows that we are trying to help them protect themselves and not sanctioning any out of borders action on their part. Adding grey area motives, like pre-positioning offensive capabilities, just feeds into Putin’s bad faith or paranoid viewpoint of NATO as some predator pacing the bars of the fence just waiting to break through and hurt Russia, instead of it being a defensive organization.",0.0288218633350035,0.0281964540481567,0.499743640422821,0.0001278817653656,0,1
post_13,post_13_2_1_1,"Okay, this could just be me being dumb, but how does this feed into an image of NATO being predatory?

In my mind, this shows that the US and NATO want to limit possible escalation but also have more ways to retaliate against Russia for doing bad things. It's putative rather than purely defensive, but putative measures are usually taken from a defensive stance, not an offensive one. In any scenario of escalation, it is Russia doing something wrong or bad to which NATO responds
 You need some way of escalating without boots on the ground or nuclear war, as more types of weapons are sent, the number of ways to retaliate to Russian misdeeds shrinks. And, inevitably, if there are no more ways for NATO to escalate without boots on the ground, Russia will exploit this by doing whatever they want. Allowing and approving limited strikes allows for a perpetual way of punishing Russia without causing out-of-control escalation. 

Now, I don't have access to NATO war planners, but usage of the escalation ladder is commonplace in NATO discussions. The inherent concern with any escelation ladder is ""What do we do when we reach the top? How do we prevent out of control escalation?"" Well, this provides a solution

Also, to be totally clear, this isn't the only reason for NATO to do this, as with most ideas on complex topics, there are many reasons the idea or decision occurred. The two major ones here are probably the base ""To prevent escalation"" at, say, 50% of the reasoning, then ""To allow perpetual retaliation"" at 40%, and a bunch of more minor reasons in the last 10%.",0.1532089533613909,0.0146986842155456,0.4997720420360565,0.001569390296936,0,0
post_13,post_13_2_1_1_1,"My point wasn’t that it IS predatory, but that any take outside of ‘we are giving them arms so they can defend themselves’—that, instead, there is an actual interest and secondary intention to use those arms offensively outside their borders—feeds into Putin’s bad faith or paranoid view on the situation: that NATO is more than a defensive alliance, but one with offensive aims and an eye on destroying Russia itself. This, as the thread began, was about the US restriction on weapons to not be used in Russia, and what those concerns were. Your comment raises a theoretical premise whose shadow very much resembles the one cast by the bogeyman Putin’s uses to portray NATO to his people, and beyond. Anyway, that is why I am skeptical: there may be some in the wargaming crowd who have this idea in their heads. But sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

Here's the [source document](https://policymemos.hks.harvard.edu/files/policymemos/files/2-23-22_ukraine-the_budapest_memo.pdf?m=1645824948) in case anyone wants to review but I copied and pasted the key points and marked who violated them.  
  
TLDR:  US and UK didn't violate the Budapest Memorandum at all.  Russia violated multiple provisions of the Budapest Memorandum.
  
1. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, reaffirm their commitment to
Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the CSCE
[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe]
Final Act, to respect the Independence and Sovereignty
and the existing borders of Ukraine.  
 * Signatory countries will respected Ukraine's borders.  
 * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Fail.  
2. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, reaffirm their obligation to refrain
from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that
none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine
except in self-defense or otherwise in accordance with
the Charter of the United Nations.  
 * Don't threaten to use force on Ukraine or use force.  
 * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Fail.  
3. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, reaffirm their commitment to
Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the CSCE 
Final Act, to refrain from economic coercion designed
to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by
Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and
thus to secure advantages of any kind.  
 * Don't use economic cooercion on Ukraine to get what you want.  
 * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Fail.  
4. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, reaffirm their commitment to seek
immediate United Nations Security Council action to
provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon
State Party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim
of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.  
 * If Ukraine is attacked with nukes or threatened with nukes, the US, UK, and Russian Federation promise to take the matter to the UNSC.  
 * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Fail.  
5. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, reaffirm, in the case of the Ukraine,
their commitment not to use nuclear weapons against
any non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, except in
the case of an attack on themselves, their territories or
dependent territories, their armed forces, or their allies,
by such a state in association or alliance with a nuclear
weapon state.  
 * Don't attack Ukraine with nukes unless Ukraine attacks you first when allied with nuclear power.  
 * US = Pass, UK = Pass, Russia = Fail.  
6. The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland will consult in the event a situation
arises which raises a question concerning these commitments.  
 * If something concerning happens, all parties will talk about it.

They did not all live in that state. They went to that state because there they can survive and possibly get help. So homless in Seattle are not all from Washington state.  Many are from Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, and other spots in the Midwest.

I’d imagine that the US undercounts the number of homeless, nevertheless, and other western countries include those in emergency or temporary accommodation as homeless.",0.0255938930737451,0.1898518800735473,0.4997673034667969,0.0173568129539489,0,1

post_17,post_17_1,"Your source touches on the why directly:

>North Korea's chronic food insecurity is the product of decades of economic mismanagement and the internal and external policies of the incumbent political regime. Throughout its history, North Korea has pursued the understandable goal of national food security through an economically irrational policy of self-sufficiency.

> inauspicious natural conditions, reliance on imported inputs such as oil used as a feedstock to produce fertilizer domestically, fertilizer imported directly from China, or donated by South Korea

>leaving the system vulnerable to disruptions to input supply emanating from global market conditions and diplomatic conflicts, in addition to the vicissitudes of weather

TLDR:

1. inauspicious conditions make it hard to grow food

2. The regime is incompetent and bad at making friends 

3. And they’re a low priority for foreign aid for a variety of reasons. 

All of which sucks for the locals.

post_17,post_17_2,"The best answer is ""yes""?

While we cannot know if the Kim regime actively decides to starve certain people or groups and feed others or if the process of food allocation is more emergent from an opaque political process, it is clear that the Kim regime could acquire more food for its people of it chose to.  North Korea is not a case of a nation impoverished purely because of it is cut off from tlmost of the rest of the world.

Let's begin with North Korea's - I'll abbreviate the countrybto DPRK - DPRK's military spending.  The CIA Fact Book published, for 2021, a [list of countries by estimated military spending](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2021/field/military-expenditures/) as a percentage of GDP.   The DPRK est8mate is 20%-30%.  The same estimate for South Korea (hereafter, ROK) is 2.64%, for the USA 3.73%, China 1.7%, Iran 2.1%, India 2.6%.  The [NATO alliance guideline](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm) for defence spending is 2%.  This is to show the DPRK is an extreme outlier in terms of its resource allocation priorities.

Aside from GPD estimates, the DPRK maintains essentially modern [nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-missile-tests-military-capabilities) while it [lacks night lighting for its civilization population](https://www.38north.org/2023/04/a-fresh-look-at-north-korea-at-night/).

Logically, if the DPRK economy refocused away from defense to either food production or anything tradeable, there would be more resources available to either eat or trade for food.  Of course, DPRK can't trade very much because they are under [heavy international sanctions](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/north-korea-sanctions-un-nuclear-weapons), but those sanctions are in place, at least formally, because of their excessive military and the threat that they pose to nearby ROK and Japan.  Note that the sanctions regime is international and includes actions by the UN Security Council (see previous source), which required the acquiescence of comparatively DPRK-friendly Russia and China, thiugh the DPRK can likely still trade extensively with Russia and China and so has access to markets and food imports that way.

Of course, the Kim regime sees the excessive spending on advanced weapons as necessary to ensure its survival, which is sort of true, because if they didn't have weapons ready to level Seoul but continued to operate as they do, then the US, ROK and Japan would love nothing more than to topple the Kim regime.  On the other hand, if the DPRK reduced its weapons portfolio and operated like a more normal country, its existence might be more tolerable to the rest of the world, but the Mr. kim wouldn't be running the DPRK the way he likes.  So, is the DPRK starving because sanctions?  Not exactly, but the regime's spending policy causes the poverty and sanctions while the spending policy is to some extent reactive to DPRK's conflict with the rest of the world.",0.0375774130882667,0.2263678312301635,0.499759316444397,0.0003668963909149,0,1

This last part would be mere conjecture on my part. It is likely a combination of a lack of resources, despite the up tick in imports and a belief that the proletariate are there for the enrichment of the ruling class . Combined with the ruling party's need to appear (both internally and externally), affluent and well nourished. It would be similar to how many oligarchys in the past have opperated.

post_17,post_17_5,"it’s really late for me so please excuse the typos and messed up timeline but i got hyperfocused on this topic a few years ago. what i gathered it’s a mix of government, resources and allies! most of the stories you’ll hear about starvation are from the later half of the 20th century. so this is a bit of what happened. 

During the war, SK and the US dropped bombs on waterways, dams, farms, factories, etc which limited their resources. later, the CIA would also sit on the chinese border and trick desperate people into destroying their livestock (this is from personal accounts, no actual documents on this i don’t think). north Koreans would try to travel to china for food, where CIA agents would offer bags of rice in exchange for cattle tails. people would go and cut off their cattle’s tail, get the food, but now their cattle is basically useless; no tail, messed up balance. what farming they COULD do must now be done without the help of [cattle](https://books.google.com/books/about/Immovable_Object.html?id=7_r_DwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description). 

then when the USSR fell they basically couldn’t trade with anyone (other than china i think?) because of different trading organizations (?). NK needed oil for what little factories and farming equipment they had. but they couldn’t get it from Russia anymore. the [US blocked](https://books.google.com/books/about/Immovable_Object.html?id=7_r_DwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description) oil from coming into the country. without oil they could only rely on farming by hand and their factories were basically shut down. 

so they were bombed by the US, denied oil, livestock useless. they couldn’t manufacture much without oil, they couldn’t farm much without oil or livestock. then came the natural disasters.

another thing is that they would not ask for help much. Jimmy Carter said himself that the US did everything they could to ruin the economy of the [north](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTS3XR3z49o) (kinda iffy source, that’s my bad). there’s a lot of factors! i just wanted to add some that i didn’t see here",0.0482540525293522,0.0261365175247192,0.4994315505027771,7.432699203491211e-05,0,1

The argument against price coast/ceilings is that it messes with the market equilibrium.

Artificially limiting the price of a product, versus alternatives, will boost its demand. Meanwhile by limiting the market price will cause long term issues in the market; limited profitability will cause manufactures to limit production/exit the market/etc leading to potential shortages.

post_18,post_18_3_1_1_1_1_2_1_1_1,"Demand curve monotonicity is a direct consequence of a prior assumption that any person who might purchase a given item will purchase if and only if they can get it for less than some fixed price that they subjectively value the item at.

Supply curve monotonicity doesn't actually hold everywhere - you get declining marginal price (that is the cost of making one additional unit goes down as the number you're already producing goes up) as economies of scale kick in, but once you've gotten there it's empirically observed that with all else hold constant the marginal cost of production increases with production volume. It doesn't super matter anyway since all that affects equilibria pricing is local behavior (that is how the curves behave near the equilibrium).

And considering the counterfactual where in the vicinity of equilibrium more units produced means the marginal cost of increased production goes down - if you observe that you're in that situation then either the item in question is about to get super cheap since increasing demand will lower prices so you don't need price caps anyway, or there's some monopolistic funny business going on and the FTC owes someone an antitrust suit.

ETA: all this math only applies where competition between firms is possible. If there's collusion between producers it all falls apart and you need external measures to reintroduce competition and price controls based on rigorous economic study of the true equilibrium price may work as a stopgap. Generally speaking if the government had perfect knowledge of the true equilibrium price it would be just as good as the market equilibrium, the issue is that in a functioning competitive market if you introduce price caps lower than the true equilibrium you introduce a deadweight loss ie a reduction in total value generated.

ETA2: this is why relatively progressive economists will advocate for taxing the rich and giving poor people money and for breaking up monopolies and other forms of relevant regulation rather than price controls - the whole point of using markets is that under certain conditions if you appropriately tax externalities and prevent monopolies and such they'll maximize generated economic value, and running a command economy that actually works - which is on a technical level the same as correctly setting price controls for everything, is brutally difficult on a technical level to the point that I don't think anyone who understands the technical difficulty of the problem thinks it can be done.",0.0283758578579759,0.0292488932609558,0.499755322933197,0.0004839897155761,0,0

post_18,post_18_3_1_1_1_1_2_1_1_1_2_1,"It's not about expectation, it's about willingness to pay. 

Underlying these models is an admittedly problematic assumption that if a person chooses to spend X dollars on a product, they would prefer to have that product than have X dollars. Maybe they'll change their minds later, but at the moment they choose to make the purchase they'd rather have the product than have X dollars.

Consider a multiversal experiment where we took the same person at the same moment and using the same context and messaging and everything offered them the same product with the only difference being the price, and they could choose yes to buy or no not to buy. At some price there'd be a breakpoint at which they're indifferent between having the money and having the item, below which they'd pay and above which they'd say fuckit I'll keep my money. Again ignore any psychological manipulation or other dishonest crap (which personally I think is a big fucking problem with how the economy works irl and needs greater academic scrutiny as a source of market failure but then again I'm not a real economist I'm just an interdisciplinary scientist who's coauthored with a couple of them so what so I know). Consider that every person would have that one price below which they'd buy and above which they wouldn't buy. It's therefore inferred that that indifference price is the subjective value the person places on the product. If Jim McRandomperson is indifferent between having 10 dollars and having the product, then that product is worth exactly 10 dollars subjectively to Jim.

The demand function for a price p tells you the number of people for whom that subjective indifference price is greater than p.... Or it could be the other way around, economists have the most insane naming conventions since they didn't start doing real math until the last century and have weird naming habits from dead people people doing the bullshit you implicitly accused me of in your first reply. But either way it's the same monotonic relationship between price p and quantity of purchases q.

post_18,post_18_4,"MBA student here. Google “1970 gas shortage”.

Essentially producers choose what quantity to produce based off the price, and if they can only get a lower price, they will produce less. This leads to widespread shortages, and is true regardless of the product in question. 

In 1970 when a gas price cap was implemented, people waited days trying to fill up their cars, and while it saved the consumer money, it was traded in for time waiting for gas. 

Now, if the government could create production minimums alongside this, that may alleviate some of the effects temporarily, but if they/the market doesn’t get to choose the price, they may choose to exit the business altogether. With suppliers dropping out of unprofitable markets, you’d be right back to a shortage. 

The market has to choose the price, which is based on supply and demand, especially for homogeneous products like oil and gas.

post_19,post_19_2,"The issue with democratic backsliding is that it's very subtle in a way that's hard to measure. I find Little & Meng very unconvincing because they focus on a very particular aspect of democracy. Most political scientists opt for one of two approaches:

- Using subjective measures based on expert opinions like V-dem and Freedom House. While these are subject to some issues, they address these very well through intercoder reliability tests and usage of a wide range of indicators. The V-dem methodological report is worth a read here.

- Using case studies. Qualitative research allows you to go really into depth in a particular case and allow you to highlight particular aspects of the backsliding process. A whole body of such studies that all point in the same direction might give some hints as that there's an ongoing trend.

In the social sciences, there are no such things as objective measures. Every measure has its advantages and disadvantages and these should be weighed carefully. The quantitative political science community generally prefers the V-dem measures. 

Biggest evidence for democratic backsliding trends are the yearly V-dem and Freedom House reports. There's a wide range of proposed explanations in the literature but no consensus on a single aspect (which hardly happens in the social sciences). A good starting point is [Waldner & Lust (2018)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628). They go over a large number of explanations.

post_19,post_19_3_1_1,"He's referring to mid-career Huntington, who developed a ""waves of democracy"" theory/framework. You can start from this Wikipedia page: [Waves of Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waves_of_democracy). It's pretty objectively true that waves of democratization happen in regional bursts which are often globally correlated. It's also true that democratic backsliding happens on similar patterns. But the regional patterns seem important. You're likely old enough to remember the anti-regime ""contagion"" of the Arab Spring. The fact that these things do seem able to jump also matters. I think there does seem to be anti-democractic contagion, too — look at the right wing leaders in Europe emulating and networking with each other. There are economic and political structures, but actors act within those structures, and these actors are influenced by others in the system.  

Huntington also came up with the ""Clash of Civilizations"" theory which made predictions which has mostly not held up. It was one of several post-Cold War predictions. Fukuyama's ""the end of history"" thesis is another; Barber's ""McWorld vs. Jihad"" is another; and Fahreed Zakaria's ""Illiberal Democracy"" may be the most prescient. 

A lot of what we see does have the trappings of democracy. They have elections. There is a real chance that figures like Orban or Erdogan could in theory be voted out (figures like Putin and Chavez/Maduro, less so). Wikipedia is a decent place to begin here: [illiberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy). This doesn't explain the *why* illiberal democracies emerge, necessarily, but it does I think help just thinking how to classify them, and to think what are the element that make up actually-existing democracy.

post_19,post_19_4_2,"Your sources say literally nothing about lobbying and the ""media doesn't tell you anything"" is so hand wavy.

""Every decade more rich and powerful"" when the past decade the share of money that the top 1% holds stayed the same and we technically aren't even at the peak of it.

The reality is that lobbying works for :

1. things that the public doesn't care about, or more specifically, doesn't vote on.

2. things that the lobbyists actually have expertise in as that's their purpose.

Anyway, I get a sense that we're trying to just harm rich people instead of advocating for policies and understanding that we can best fund those policies with progressive tax policies, the former has no real purpose other than spite.

If income gap was the main driver then why are Nordic countries also leaning right?

Democracy just means majority. If El Salvador appreciated a hard crackdown on gangs, and post doing so he's perhaps the most popular leader in El Salvador that doesn't make him authoritarian. He's doing democracy as well, but to better ends in my opinion, making his country safer.

My point being the far left people I am referencing don't really mean other countries are ""moving away from democracy"". They are often democratic. All these articles written about Nayib's crackdown and election being undemocratic, politicians like Omar and the State Department being concerned. The local citizens love him. It is very democratic, they just don't like him doing the opposite of what they want.

Or Russia for example. Putin was re-elected by a good margin. His popularity is higher after the Ukraine war, even liberal parties in Russia are very against our NATO expansion up to Russia. They call that ""harming democracy"" or whatever, which just means its something they don't like even though it is democracy.

Wrong. This is the very narrow definition and not the common parlance (and please don't go quoting the dictionary now).

post_19,post_19_6_2_1_3_1_1,">So you're saying the democracy definition needs to be exactly as western minds and governments define it, even if the will of the majority of the people in that country don't support that definition

Huh? What do you mean, supporting a definition? *Words mean things.* I mean, I'm sure you can the meaning of the word 'democracy' up to a vote 'by the people' or something but that... doesn't actually change the meaning of the word 'democracy' into 'ruling by decree is now also democracy' (no matter what North Korea tries to tell you).

Democracy is a scale, sure - there are stronger and weaker democracies, and people argue about what is more or less democratic continuously. But at its core it means the power lies with the people. What these guys are doing is trying to get the power to be with them and theirs, only.

>they vote for leaders who lead different than we expect it's anti democracy

No. Again, no. It is not 'lead different than we expect'. It is very specific. Like, Orban took steps to curtail freedom of speech *for everyone*, for example [by putting large fines on 'objectionable content'](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/media-law-outrage-hungary-s-orbanization-is-worrying-europe-a-736706.html) which is very vague and determined by a committee directed by Orban.

Such a measure is, by its very nature, undemocratic. - it takes the power to protest, discuss and engage in politics away from the people. These things are exactly why everyone is always so up in arms about freedom of speech. This is **actual, real censorship** - by a government and everything. Like, 100% that.

More importantly, Orban [has been governing by decree](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-investment-climate-statements/hungary/) - meaning, bypassing parliament - since november 2020 (first because covid, then the war, then...who knows) and it's [recently been extended to 2024](https://dailynewshungary.com/the-hungarian-government-has-extended-state-of-emergency-and-compulsary-action/). That's not 'different'. That is plain undemocratic. That is ignoring the rule of law and taking the power to do whatever he wants.

Yes, a majority of people can vote in a leader or leaders who then lead undemocratically - it happens all the time. The important question is: is it guaranteed the people can freely and openly campaign and elect someone else if they want to vote them out again?

Oh, also: republics have nothing to do with anything. I live in a constitutional monarchy with plenty checks and balances. Different thing altogether. It's the 'constitutional' that matters, not whose face is next to the flag.

post_20,post_20_3,"Just so people are informed, it's a good idea to understand how marginal progressive tax rates work. This [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYeZko1WKHQ) (transcript in the description) explains it pretty well. The upshot is, the top marginal rate is not the rate paid on every dollar earned, and most people don't make enough that any of their income will even reach that rate.

Capital gains are currently taxed at a preferential (lower for most taxpayers) rate. The administration's proposal is to tax long term capital gains as ordinary income for those earning more than $1 million per year in adjusted gross income. From OP's source about the revenue proposals:

> Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends of taxpayers with taxable income of more than $1 million would be taxed at ordinary rates   
> [...]   
>  For example, a taxpayer with $1,100,000 in taxable income of which $200,000 is preferential capital income would have $100,000 of capital income taxed at the preferential rate and $100,000 taxed at ordinary rates.

Because the proposed change targets high earners in this way, it [would affect fewer than 0.3 percent of taxpayers,](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/biden-proposals-would-reduce-large-tax-advantages-for-those-at-the-top-address) and only in the years when they sell long-term capital assets for a gain.

A few years back, [we discussed the idea of taxing capital gains as ordinary income](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/bjujtn/what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_taxing_capital/) for *all* taxpayers. The top comment there is very informative and strongly in favor of the idea. The current Biden proposal doesn't go so far, as it only applies to the top 0.3% of earners. So, on the surface, this proposal seems well targeted and relatively tame.

As to whether it's worth it, probably not. It's a safe bet that many high earners will either shift their investments away from such assets or find ways to shelter their gains from the tax, so I'd be surprised if the government ever sees close to the projected revenue increase from this move. And even if it did, $289 billion over 10 years is just 0.3% of the [total projected budgets over the same period.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/budget_fy2025.pdf) This seems like a pretty significant shift to the tax code that's easily circumvented, may have some deleterious effects, and doesn't raise a lot of money. There are more effective and efficient ways to increase revenue in the same proposal and my belief is that it'd be better to concentrate on those.",0.0258238145286378,0.3700371980667114,0.4997520446777344,0.0014756619930267,1,0

The ""[consent of the governed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed)"" is a bedrock principle of modern democratic systems. Separatist movements can arise when a group feels the state is exercising power over it without their consent. Under that paradigm, a government that wishes to deter separatism, and the potentially resultant balkanization, needs to ensure that the distinct groups under its control have a sense that they are consenting to be governed.

When those groups have lost that sense, questions arise about whether there is a natural ""[right of secession.](https://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=annlsurvey)"" (PDF) In the US, a brutal war was fought over the [Confederate States'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America) claim they had a right to secede over slavery.

post_22,post_22_1,"1. The wall has [flood gates](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N3AC241/) that must be kept open during the wet seasons due to flooding. Otherwise, buildup of debris risks destroying the wall.

2. The wall actually divides [private property](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/17/texas-border-wall-landowner/) in the US, so there are additional gates that are kept open so private landowners can access their property on the other side of the wall.

3. This one I’m not 100% certain of, but migrants only need to be on US soil to claim asylum. Since the border wall is built on US territory and *not* directly on the border, migrants would legally be able to claim asylum without crossing the wall in theory. Pretty sure this is why Texas installed those floating death traps in the Rio Grand.

post_22,post_22_6,"I think almost all of the available evidence shows that modern border walls are incredibly successful at significantly impacting and lowering illegal immigration across the board. Most of the counterexamples I've seen are by critics who point out walls that are either undermanned or underfunded, or don't have reliable data.

In contrast, if you look at some of the most successful border walls, they decrease illegal immigration by 90%+

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\_West\_Bank\_barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier)

[https://globalchallenges.ch/figure/fact-sheet-the-israeli-west-bank-barrier/](https://globalchallenges.ch/figure/fact-sheet-the-israeli-west-bank-barrier/)

Specifically looking at Israel's west bank barrier, it has been incredibly effective at lowering illegal immigration by 90%+, and cost a fraction of what it would cost the US in terms of a percentage of GDP to solve such a large issue. 

Indeed, even when the US has tried putting up barriers in certain areas those areas are avoided by illegal immigrants, per historical research.

[https://econ.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/283/2020/06/Fenced\_Out\_0622\_2020.pdf](https://econ.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/283/2020/06/Fenced_Out_0622_2020.pdf)

The fact is, most of the arguments against the effectiveness of a border wall are derived from conjecture and ""what if"" scenarios, not from real, recent historical data. 

With the use of modern technology like infrared lighting to detect large groups of people, border walls would be incredibly helpful to CBP in funneling large groups of migrants to certain areas (As people have mentioned, areas of the wall that are constantly attacked and destroyed with tools). Even the CBP agents on the ground support a wall. 

[https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/video-gallery/video-library/walls-work](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/video-gallery/video-library/walls-work)

Again, the goal isn't to completely stop illegal immigration- it's to significantly decrease illegal crossings.

And it will require a massive hiring increase for border patrol guards, massive urban planning,  architecture, and engineering effort. You have to plan routes for estimated migrant crossing flow, set up safe entry points, increased volume of legal services, maintain the wall in a variety of climates and terrains. And all of this across 2000 miles. This would be an unprecedented effort and would require buy-in from multiple executive agencies coordinating together.

You have to coordinate the DoJ, DoHS, DoI, and more. You have to make sure the ecological impact is negligible, no concerns for endangered wildlife, proper emergency service availability, legal challenges in every state, etc.

Estimates vary so widely because no one is even clear on what the requirements are of this wall. Is it going to be solid concrete? A large gate? What exactly is going to be built? Who is going to build it? Where is it getting built? 

In reality all that link you shared proves is that the wall will cost AT LEAST 25B. That’s the money congress approved for it so far. There are so many unknowns. 

One example is how will Native American nations react to a wall being built through their land? US law allows free travel through the border for tribal governments. How do you think that is going to fly for them when a 30 ft concrete slab goes up restricting their freedom of movement on their land? Not an easy legal challenge to resolve.

This is a crucial distinction. [People crossing the border without authorization ""typically"" wait to be apprehended and indicate they are seeking asylum](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/), at which point a large fraction of them are released for legal temporary residence in the US for the duration of their asylum review process. That duration is years because the process has a backlog of three million cases. If asylum is approved, people who entered the country without authorization become legal immigrants; if not, they are ordered to be deported.

So by preventing illegal crossings, a border wall would effectively block both legal and illegal immigration. Another view of the issue would be: why is it so difficult for refugees to enter the country legally that they'll risk their lives and cross the border illegally just to apply for asylum? Or, why is the asylum process so slow that migrants without valid refugee claims will risk their lives and cross the border illegally just to live in America for a few years, or use that time to disappear?

post_22,post_22_9,"**I. Summary**

From the research below, my conclusion is that objectors to border walls are not basing their objections on the efficacy of border fences which have proven extremely effective when manned. Manned should be understood as a euphemism to mean ""when combined with the use of physical force or violence to repel illegal immigrants"".

**II. Factual Analysis**

Border walls have proven extremely effective when manned, as can be summarized from the available authoritative studies from the extreme difficulty of individuals crossing the Berlin Wall during the Cold War, to the extreme reduction in net-illegal migration from Morocco to Spain from the construction of the Cuerta wall (and its later doubling in size). Edina Lilla Meszaros, [Barbed Wire, Border Walls and the 'Art' of Fencing out Migrants and Refugees: An Assessment of the EU and American Bordering Practices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3489076), 18 RES. & SCI. TODAY 75, at 78, 82 (2019).

**Cueta Fence and Walls Severely Dropped Morocco to Spain Immigration.**

The Cueta ""fences met the expectations of their builders, as from 2005 until 2013/2014 they have managed to keep away major flows of immigrants, instead forcing them to choose more perilous routes through the sea."" *Id*. These fences were reinforced in 2005, manned by agents with thermal goggles, CCTV, and other devices. *Id*. Most immigrants did not choose sea travel because its perilous nature so they remain where they are. *Id*.

However, while the wall was extremely effective, attempts at breakthrough ended in death and western nations have developed a policy against killing illegal immigrants, thus Spain modified its side of the wall to remove a layer of razor wire, increase height of less dangerous parts of the wall to more safely deter immigration *Id*. at 84. However, Morocco put up the Razorwire on its side of the wall, using money granted to it by the EU. *Id*.

**Hungarian/EU Border Fences Severely Dropped Immigration from 764,033 in 2015 to 5,869 in 2018.**

In 2015 there was an extreme rise of migration into the EU from the Western Balkans Route. *Id*. at 83. Hungary received ""174,400 first time asylum applications"" but only determined that ""545"" claims were valid, that almost all were economic migrants. *Id*. Germany received 441,800 asylum applications, but with its much laxer standards at the time, admitted 148,215 qualified, but over two thirds were baseless. *Id*.

In response to the influx of ""economic migrants who came to Europe for financial benefits"", Hungary, Germany, Austria, Greece, and Macedonia all built border walls and nations adopted policy changes to Asylum procedures and Criminal Codes to deter immigration. *Id*. at 84-85. Illegal immigration along that route is down to 5,869 as of 2018. *Id*.

**Excellent Study Shows Usage and Effects of Walls**

David B. Carter & Paul Poast, [Why Do States Build Walls? Political Economy, Security, and Border Stability](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26363882), 61 J. CONFLICT RESOL. 239 (2017) is an extremely good read on this subject. Largely, we see walls for either military reasons or when a wealthier nation borders a poorer nation. There are border walls in every continent except South America, and there is a really cool table spanning pages 249-250 that shows all of the various walls built by different nations. The authors, like the author of the previous studies, critique human cost of walls.

But they do not challenge their effectiveness.",0.026180617229931,0.0923501253128051,0.4997493028640747,0.9454086720943452,0,1
post_22,post_22_9_1,"**III. Other Considerations**

The United States is much lighter on regulation than the EU and one of the biggest challenges we have is that illegal immigrants are actually able to secure work in our country. 44% of farm workers are illegal immigrants.  [https://www.farmworkerjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAWS-data-fact-sheet-FINAL.docx-3.pdf](https://www.farmworkerjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAWS-data-fact-sheet-FINAL.docx-3.pdf) . ""\[I\]n other migrant-heavy sectors, the share of illegals is... smaller (typically about a fifth)."" [https://www.compactmag.com/article/an-epidemic-of-exploitation/](https://www.compactmag.com/article/an-epidemic-of-exploitation/) . Because EVerify is not used, employers of illegal immigrants get a workforce they can exploit and expose to danger, such as the current milkbourne virus H5N1. *Id*. They also lower wages for lower skilled employees. *Id*. It is more attractive to come to the US because people can actually work here once they get in, even if the conditions are awful.

**IV. Conclusion**

Walls are effective when they are manned and properly. The better arguments against walls focus on human rights angles or globalism as a desirable philosophy. There is strong evidence that walls combined with physical force are a deterrent.",0.027376077054203,0.0171678662300109,0.4997729957103729,0.0016202628612518,0,0

The major issue is that the US gives free stuff to people who break the law.  Given the US stopped giving free stuff to people who break the law, there would be a lot less to deal with on the Illegal immigration issue.  In the 1990's, a lot of the illegal immigrant issues were due to migrant workers not going home.  The situation has become worse.

*Plyler v. Doe*Plyler v. Doe, for example, allowed for Illegal Immigrant children to receive US public education.  That was back in 1982.  Given people didn't feel comfortable, in the US, after breaking the law, many of them would not be in the US.

The Law, that is immigration law, it is not handled the same for everyone.  Given someone came here on a student visa, they wouldn't get away with a lot of the stuff people arriving, lately, from South America have been getting away with.

For over three decades, however, Social Security collected more in payroll taxes and other income than it paid in benefits and other expenses, and the Treasury invested the surplus in interest-bearing Treasury securities, ultimately reaching a total of $2.9 trillion in trust fund reserves. In 2021 Social Security began redeeming those reserves to help pay benefits. Payroll taxes from current workers will continue to pay for the bulk of benefits.

----

The system has been [sustained for 88 years,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Social_Security_in_the_United_States) through many turbulent economic times, and has never failed to pay out the contracted benefits, even as those benefits have increased dramatically.

As projected, the system [went ""cash negative""](https://www.ueunion.org/political-action/2013/phony-crisis-the-money-is-there-for-social-security) this year, which means that **if** Congress fails to act, the SSA could have a [shortfall to pay benefits around 2034.](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/31/politics/social-security-benefits-decrease/index.html)

I'm quite a bit older than the average Redditor, but this is about the 12th fake ""social security is going broke"" panic I've witnessed in my lifetime. I remember people saying the same thing back in the mid 1980s, both before and a few years after the [1983 Social Security reforms.](https://www.ssa.gov/history/tally1983.html) And before that, there were the [1977 reforms,](https://www.ssa.gov/history/notchfile3.html) passed under the cloud of similar ""doom and gloom"" rhetoric.

post_25,post_25_1,"> the typical starting wage for fast food jobs in 2024 is about $13/hr

In the wake of the pandemic, there was a [dramatic labor shortage,](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/11/how-mcdonalds-and-wendys-are-dealing-with-fast-food-labor-shortages.html) causing fast food outlets specifically to have a hard time filling positions. That drove up the typical wages of those and similar jobs. 

It's a supply and demand issue. It's not related to the statutory minimum. If there were a surplus of labor, you'd see those wages drop, especially in areas with low cost of living.

Since that time, however, [unemployment has remained low](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm) and [labor constraints in food services have remained high,](https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-bulletin/labor-constraints-and-strong-demand-are-driving-robust-food-services-inflation/) providing support for the high wages.

post_25,post_25_2,"1: Yes. Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not seem to have a number for 2023 yet, [141,000 workers were paid exactly the federal minimum wage](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2022/home.htm). The source also notes that these people are primarily from DC, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Rhode Island.

2) People against raising minimum wage [have varying arguments against raising it.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets-economy/090516/what-are-pros-and-cons-raising-minimum-wage.asp). The most prevalent one is ""workers currently making the minimum wage will lose their jobs if the minimum wage goes up, as their employers will no longer be able to hire them and the business will close. $7.25/hour>$0/hour, so we should keep the wage as is."" The second most prevalent one (from what I've seen) is ""the states should decide their minimum wage. The federal minimum wage should be a low baseline, as states and regions within those states with very low cost-of-living may not require a higher minimum wage to live comfortably there.""

3) Unfortunately, this statistic seems to be pretty difficult to find. Wages aren't public information, and companies aren't incentivized to publicly say ""we're paying at or barely above minimum wage!""

Anecdotally, it is *possible* to live comfortably on minimum wage in some areas. When I was volunteering in West Virginia, I got paid the fedeal minimum wage as a stipend. My yearly income income ($13,502 after federal taxes) was well below the food stamp threshold (130% of the poverty line, or $19,578), so I qualified for food stamps. Due to living in rural West Virginia, my rent was also quite low; only $575 for a one-bedroom apartment. Other government assistance programs allowed me to get a free gym membership and free internet, meaning my monthly expenses were only around $650/month including rent, food, and entertainment. This gave me a surplus of $475/month.

TL:DR Some areas of the country have a much lower cost of living. The federal minimum wage says ""even in those crazy low COL areas, you still have to pay $7.25/hour."" As such, people can still make the federal minimum wage and have their basic neess met (although you probably have to get government assistance).

[https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2021/home.htm](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2021/home.htm)

We can see from this report that as of 2021 181k people make minimum wage and 910k working below. These are primarily hospitality/ recreational jobs being worked part time by people under the age of 25. With the majority of the workers at minimum wage receiving tips to supplement their income.

In table 2, We can see a larger number in the South, ( about double other regions), But those are disproportionately in the ""Below minimum wage"" category which means they're operating on the alternate minimum wage for tipped workers.

  
So based on that, the only people reportedly making minimum wage are tipped staff largely. (Who may or may not be reporting their tips accurately to begin with and are not reflecting their actual income into the data)

  
2. It would disproportionately effect small businesses in rural and low income areas by creating larger barriers to entry for the creation of small businesses. A lot of people will espouse the trite saying that ""If a business can't afford to pay it's workers a living wage, then it shouldn't exist. "" The people who say this are largely also going to be people bemoaning the fact that everything in their life is purchased through a large corporation, complain about late stage capitalism and never even realized they strangled the local options in the crib.

Also raising the federal minimum wage will always be contentious. Universal mandated increased costs will always favor larger, wealthier, established entities. That also applies to states as well. Higher mandates leaves poorer states and regions completely reliant on outside investment and effectively turns poor regions of the country into ""internal colonies"" by regulating that only rich entities from wealthy areas to be able to afford the operating costs and just keep a region sucked dry of any actual investment.

Minimum wage should have always been a state and local issue such that it could be tailor fit for local cost of living.

  
There is also a chance that the data is poorly collected. Given the number of tipped staff at minimum wage, and the propensity of tips to be under reported, we could raise minimum wage and not actually have any real effect on the people you're trying to help. They'll just report the new higher minimum wage and keep under reporting any tips they receive.

First, its an even playing field. Second, rural areas are dominated by large corporations, cities are hotspots where ""one guy who knows the business"" has ample customers to chase if he wants to go solo. 80% of jobs are in cities (and yes, sub-Urbs are part of the city, its in the name).

> Universal mandated increased costs will always favor larger, wealthier, established entities.

A living wage is the backbone of the middle class. If ""getting by"" is an exotic luxury, then you don't have the opportunity to walk away from the table if you are getting a bad deal. You can't negotiate if you can't do that.

> the cost of living alone is still statistically difficult for the typical low wage worker

The [minimum wage,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States) meaning the lowest wage one can legally pay to, for example, someone with no experience, such as a teenager or a new immigrant who doesn't speak the language, is not set at a level designed to allow that person to afford their own apartment.

Although many people understandably [argue the minimum wage should be a living wage,](https://bobbyscott.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/labor-leaders-introduce-bill-raise-minimum-wage) it's not historically understood as a living *alone* wage. It was designed to prevent exploitation of people on the lowest rung of the employment ladder and it assumed they'd be living with family or in some other kind of communal situation.

As people get more experience, they work their way up the wage scale, eventually getting to the point where they can share an apartment with a roommate or two, but living alone has long been a luxury that only people making at least double the minimum wage could afford. (Note that this is different in rural communities, due to cultural norms and supply/demand issues, but in urban areas, that's how it has been.)

In 2009, when the minimum wage was raised to $7.25 per hour, a person working a 40-hour week would earn $290 before taxes, or about $1210 a month, assuming 50 weeks a year. 

Since you mentioned Pennsylvania, let's take a city like Pittsburgh as an example, which falls in the [middle of the cost-of-living range](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/region_rankings_current.jsp?region=021) for U.S. cities. A studio apartment there [cost $541 per month](https://www.rentdata.org/pittsburgh-pa-hud-metro-fmr-area/2009) in 2009, or 45% of income. In 2007, the minimum wage was set at $5.85, yielding a monthly full-time gross of about $975. A studio apartment in Pittsburgh [cost $570 per month then,](https://www.rentdata.org/pittsburgh-pa-hud-metro-fmr-area/2007) or 58% of income.

post_25,post_25_5_1_1,"Our overall goal is to help the poor the most we can, right? I argue setting the minimum wage to pay a livable wage can actually be a net negative to the poor, and we should directly give them welfare instead.

If we increase the minimum wage, two things happen. First, the pay of people making minimum increase, which is objectively good, and the number of jobs available to them decreases. This is because at the higher wage, it is simply not worth it to pay someone to do certain jobs because paying them would be a net loss. This is a reasonable statement right?

At some point the number of jobs lost is worse for the poor than the increase in pay. This means the optimal minimum wage that helps poor people the most is not nessicarily a living wage, and in fact the two are completely unrelated, so we shouldn't strive to set the minimum wage to a living wage but rather the one that helps the poor the most.

Instead, we should give welfare directly to the poor to put their income to a higher level, because it gives them money directly without reducing their rates of employment.

Basically, setting a high minimum wage can make people net worse off, because although those who find low pay jobs are better off, there are less jobs overall.

""In my Inaugural I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country. It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By ""business"" I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living.""

Decent living has never meant ""living alone"", especially in an age when one working income supporting a family was not just common but the default, so that implies decent living with a family

How on earth can that be twisted into meaning one single working adult shouldn't be able to live alone?

post_25,post_25_5_2_1,"There are some good points here. 

The truth is, there's been [a lot of inflation](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2009?amount=7.25) since 2009, but the minimum wage hasn't been adjusted. According to a link in your first source, it was raised 17 times in the 50 years prior to that, which is a little more frequently than once every three years on average. So, the fact that we've gone 15 years without an adjustment is definitely unusual and it would make sense that fewer people are actually being paid that wage now.

One potential way to eliminate the tipped workers from the BLS numbers is to include only those who are making exactly the minimum, because [tipped workers](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped) are often the only ones allowed to be paid less over the course of a full year. It's not the most solid premise, but perhaps worth exploring.

2010 was the first full year with the $7.25 minimum. The [BLS report for that year](https://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2010.htm) says:

> 72.9 million American workers age 16 and over were paid at hourly rates, representing 58.8 percent of all wage and salary workers. Among those paid by the hour, 1.8 million earned exactly the prevailing Federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.

That comes out to 2.5% of all hourly workers.

By contrast, the [2022 BLS report](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2022/home.htm) says:

> 78.7 million workers age 16 and older in the United States were paid at hourly rates, representing 55.6 percent of all wage and salary workers. Among those paid by the hour, 141,000 workers earned exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.

That's only 0.18% of all hourly workers, and the report itself says they're mostly not working full-time.

I wouldn't call this conclusive evidence, but it certainly supports your hypothesis that not enough people are currently being paid the hourly minimum to imply that a moderate increase would have any effect on the broader economy.

I still have my doubts about using fast food service work as a marker. I can think of a bunch of jobs that *should* pay lower than that, but I also wasn't able to find any job listings to prove the supposition.",0.0270396441211381,0.5676590204238892,0.49974524974823,0.0011797547340393,1,0
post_25,post_25_5_2_1_1,"So I looked closer. The 2022 BLS report (https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2022/home.htm) also says right at the top: ""The data are obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a national monthly survey of approximately 60,000 eligible households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Information on earnings is collected from one-fourth of the CPS sample each month. The CPS does not include questions on whether workers are covered by the minimum wage provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) or by individual state or local minimum wage laws. The estimates of workers paid at or below the federal minimum wage are based solely on the hourly wage they report, which does not include overtime pay, tips, or commissions.""

My interpretation of that is people reporting the exact amount of $7.25 may still be making more in tips, and most probably are: 

Because it also says : ""The industry with the highest percentage of workers earning hourly wages at or below the federal minimum wage in 2022 was leisure and hospitality (about 7 percent). About 3 in 5 of all workers paid at or below the federal minimum wage were employed in this industry, almost entirely in restaurants, bars, and other food services. (See table 5.)""

and

""Among major occupational groups, service occupations had the highest percentage of hourly paid workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage, at 4 percent. Nearly 3 out of 4 workers earning the minimum wage or less in 2022 were employed in service occupations, mostly in food preparation and serving-related jobs. For many of these workers, tips may supplement the hourly wages received. (See table 4.)""

This all supports the tipped position theory. There may be a small amount of workers who are untipped in the food industry who make bare minimum--- cooks, fast food. But if you actually open up those tables you will see the other industries reporting at or below include education, retail, and manufacturing. Unclear what jobs that entails and why they would be below which requires exceptions to the law or illegal pay. The report suggests some survey respondents may be rounding down their wage.   


Still  there is no evidence of $7.25 wages perusing 2024 job listings. In current inflationary conditions each year that goes by the wages get farther and farther from the legal minimums, so this 2022 is not even good data now. Mississippi is ranked as having the lowest cost of living (https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/least-expensive-states). And follows the federal minimum wage. So perusing entry level jobs on zip recruiter in MS what are the lowest paid jobs I can find?....Circle K gas station starting at $13.25. Travel center Cook 11.50. Dental Receptionist $12. Personal care attendent $9.75. Cricket Wireless 12.50. Murphy Gas station $9.25. Oh the winner appears to be Popeyes chicken starting at $8/hr. What they list and what people get hired at is an unknown. But another point there in support of fast food being the floor.",0.0242714555471127,0.3106250762939453,0.4997491836547851,0.0003451108932495,0,0
post_25,post_25_5_3,"As for the livability of and lifestyle supported by a minimum wage and what is moral, possible etc. that is a different issue, but also interesting and necessary I think to look at with data. I see a lot of people online say things along the lines of ""my father bought a suburban house and supported our whole family working as a shoe salesman"". This raises some questions 1)is that true? Is that common? 2) was shoe salesman formerly a minimum wage job, or was it potentially more lucrative with large commissions? Historically what have been the entry level ""minimum wage"" jobs? 3)How has the livability of the minimum wage changed over time? (or more to my point, how has the livability of the realistic wage of the lowest wage jobs changed over time)?

This chart (https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/172eiap/median\_national\_home\_price\_relative\_to\_federal/) suggests home ownership was once much more feasible on a minimum wage, which would suggest that renting was also once much more affordable. 

Here is a graph with overall purchasing power (https://www.epi.org/blog/the-minimum-wage-has-lost-21-of-its-value-since-congress-last-raised-the-wage/) which has fallen. This is out of date and it would fall even more.  But as per my key point, it may not be a meaningful figure. 

Then the livability of the minimum wage might be better compared with the cost of a lower end apartment than median. HUD uses a number called the fair market rent which is the 40th percentile. (https://www.rentdata.org/lookup). In florida where I live now this site lists a studio at $1048 which seems realistic for a number that is supposed to represent below average. If I were to go out and get a $14/hr job (there are many, state minimum in florida is $12) that would be 44% of my income. Which is doable, but I would need to rent from an individual and not a property management company that checks your paystubs for the 3x amount.

post_25,post_25_12,"Pt1: Fundamentals of Economics

In the introduction to economics (macroeconomics and microeconomics), we learned that the [Washington Consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus) was the basis for modern economic theory.

During this, we learned a lot about how economics is firstly _extremely complicated_ with so many factors for which it is hard or impossible to account. But, the basic math and models tell us that by doing stuff like increasing the minimum wage mandated, we start to see employers hiring fewer employees and the opening of ""Black Market"" jobs (jobs that aren't reported to the government, think everything from when you hire the teenager down the street to be your babysitter and you pay in cash down to shady corporations hiring people abroad to do jobs but not telling the government). 

Now, as you can imagine, this has negative effects on society and the government. Less revenue for the government, fewer jobs for the individual. However, this obviously isn't the full story because, without any government intervention, you may start seeing employers exploiting workers. But if they aren't and people feel largely like their wage is fair, minimum wage doesn't need to be increased.

So! To make a long story short: Because the federal government doesn't feel like it would help or improve anything to increase the minimum wage. They only want to intervene when they need to.

Pt2: The Organization of America

In the US, we organize things differently than many of our contemporaries. This is for a variety of reasons, ranging from our origins to our size. The result is that federal laws and regulations have to be a good idea across the country for them to be a good idea. This is really where the federal minimum wage has problems. The US has _vastly_ different costs of living depending on location. A wage of $100,000/year could be enough to buy a house, raise a family and live comfortably. It could also be so little that you can barely afford rent and have to eat Ramen every night because that's all you can afford while you spiral deeper and deeper into debt as you struggle for even the basics. The difference is location. LA will be different than rural Nebraska. 

If you make minimum wage, say, $15 an hour, this will be far too low for West Hollywood but far too high for rural Nebraska. So, the general thought process becomes... let's just let States figure this one out. So, what states have done is made it so their state minimum wage reflects the minimum cost of living in the state (in theory, in practice, it's hit or miss), then have specific counties or municipalities have a higher minimum wage. For example, California has a minimum wage of $16/hr. However, West Hollywood has a minimum wage of $19.08 (source: https://www.paycor.com/resource-center/articles/california-minimum-wage/)
In Washington, the minimum wage is $16.28, but Seattle has a minimum wage of $19.97 (source: https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/minimum-wage/) 

So, in other words, another reason is that the US is so varied that it makes sense to do what the US was designed to do and have the States handle as much as you can let them, and then the federal government handles the rest.",0.0276571686775299,0.0108235478401184,0.4997618794441223,0.0002439022064208,0,1

It is actually rather homogenous, as people and businesses will move for more optimal conditions. Yes, there are hotspots, but we have a half hour average commute because people are fully aware that they may need to commute a few counties over to make their budget work with the job they can get, so it is useful to look at it by metro area.

Some highlights from the article:  

Illinois’ historic pretrial reform has largely passed its first test, with no major scandals and no immediate impact on crime trends. Implementation has been mostly smooth as well, although uneven.

In Cook County, the change was supported by leaders and was an extension of reforms already in place. But officials in smaller downstate counties have been stretched thin by the requirements of the new system.

Three months is not enough time to determine the impact the new system is having on crime rates, but he and his team are hitting the road soon to see how the law is playing out throughout the state.

One thing they have seen already, though, is the elimination of bail has driven down jail populations across Illinois. The amount of that decrease in jail population varies by the size of the county.

In some of the smaller, more rural jails, where historically people might have been held for offenses that are not detainable, the decreases in the jail populations have been larger than in some of the larger jails, where the majority of people held in jail are those charged with more serious offenses.

So, no spike in crime but a decrease in jail populations.",0.0247511316521474,0.3194559216499328,0.4997373521327972,0.0527455508708953,0,1

post_27,post_27_1,"In my opinion, the best argument for right to disconnect laws would be found in the very nature of employment agreements.

The work, time, and compensation should all be as clearly defined as possible.

“But for generations after independence, Haitians were forced to pay the descendants of their former slave masters, including the Empress of Brazil; the son-in-law of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I; Germany’s last imperial chancellor; and Gaston de Galliffet, the French general known as the “butcher of the Commune” for crushing an insurrection in Paris in 1871.

The burdens continued well into the 20th century. The wealth [Haitian] ancestors coaxed from the ground (coffee and sugar) brought wild profits for a French bank that helped finance the Eiffel Tower, Crédit Industriel et Commercial, and its investors.

post_28,post_28_2,"Using a [calculator](https://www.historicalstatistics.org/Currencyconverter.html) for these things, the original 150m franc indemnity would be something like $1.5B today. This sum was at some point cut in half ~13 years later, and finally Haiti only paid 113m francs total ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti_Independence_Debt)).

While the $21b figure cited by Wikipedia and elsewhere is cited as fact, I've never seen a scholarly, accepted source ([one source they reference](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/world/americas/haiti-aristide-reparations-france.html)), and sounds like simple wishful thinking, without seeing some data to back this up (of course, inflation calculators already have the 'expected return of having money' baked into them, as they compare [buying power](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/purchasingpower.asp) of the currency to get an accurate measure).

You're also no doubt assuming there is no justification for the indemnity to begin with, and like many on this platform probably assume it has something to do with the cost of the slaves. From what I've read, this isn't the case.

First the calculation - [source documents](https://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_1631-0438_2003_num_90_340_4058) show it to be a calculation based on the amount of money earned from Haitian plantations over the years preceding the slave revolution. Nothing to do with the value of slaves or other property, but an expected return from farming the region optimally. And this is not unfounded; the land was owned by the French, though it could be said they took it from the [Taino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno) (which if you accept would imply neither the former slaves nor the French should control it). Ignoring that, there was a claim by the owners that their land was taken from them and they wanted restitution. Naturally in modern times, we would say the land was suitable forfeit for the atrocities inflicted upon the Africans brought to Haiti, and - like with the US revolution - would say those living there deserve the spoilers of their justly waged war.

But unfortunately, it didn't end there. The [revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution#1791_slave_rebellion) itself had many phases lasting from 1791-1804, after the conclusion of which it was decided by the Haitian powers that all whites in Haiti should be killed, with women and children not being spared (a few Poles and Germans were, though). I've read that ""Caribbean genocide: racial war in Haiti"" by Girard is a good summary that describes both said murders and rampant raping of said victims before their eventual slaying, but I can't find a non pay-gated version; there is a fanstatic [summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ktt0j/would_the_1804_haiti_massacre_of_the_white_french/) from a question in AskHistories some years back. Basically, the French has really good reason to dislike the Haitians, as what might have been forgiven as the inevitable loss of land instead escalated into one of the most complete race focused genocides of a people that I am aware of.

From that, the French being less forgiving of perceived economic losses feels a bit less absurd, in context. 

Also it's worth mentioning that Haiti has received a [colossal amount of aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_aid_to_Haiti#:~:text=Between%20the%20fiscal%20years%20of,this%2C%20living%20conditions%20remain%20poor.) in the last century, which eclipses payments made on the debt, which itself ended in 1947.",0.0771811029837472,0.3618921637535095,0.4997559189796448,9.325146675109865e-05,0,1

Nothing to do with the value of slaves or other property, but an expected return from farming the region optimally.

You can't really separate the ""expected return from farming the region"" from the fact that the laborers that were farming the region were enslaved. I get what you're saying about the Independence debt being based on the loss of land, but saying ""nothing to do with the value of slaves"" is kinda disingenuous. All of these things were inextricably linked in the early modern colonial economy of the Caribbean. These societies have been called ""slave societies"" rather than  ""societies with slaves,"" because the early modern plantation complex of the Caribbean was fundamentally structured around enslaved labor ([source](https://www.uwipress.com/9789766405854/the-first-black-slave-society/)). So, while I do agree that it is not exactly accurate to say that the self-liberated Haitians had to ""pay for their own freedom,"" their enslavement was a requisite for the economy to function. Even if the calculations were based on a model of production where laborers were actually paid a wage ( can't tell from the docs you shared cuz I dont know French ha), the argument you mention about the Am Rev and the 'spoils of war' I think is relevant, like you said. No empire has ever paid for territory they conquer, I don't think, and to my knowledge it certainly never happened in the Caribbean / the Americas during the conquest or the wars for Latin Am wars of Independence.

But regarding the terrifying racial violence that took place on the island post-Independence, this was an entirely reactionary response to what was the equally horrendous violence of plantation slavery in the Caribbean. Laurent Dubois has talked about this (there's an article version somewhere out there but probably also behind a paywall, reference is [here](https://thelouvertureproject.org/index.php?title=Avenging_America:_The_Politics_of_Violence_in_the_Haitian_Revolution), but both of his books [Avengers of the New World](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674018266) and [Haiti: The Aftershocks of History](https://history.duke.edu/books/haiti-aftershocks-history) provide a lot of necessary context for the discussion of the history of violence and the Haitian Revolution). The colonial society of French Saint-Domingue was one built around racial terror and violence (this is Beckles ""Slave society"" model). African slaves were often worked to death, as a matter of practice, and sexual violence against enslaved women was the norm. I agree with you that the violence that succeeded the Haitian Revolution against the remaining white population was horrifying, racially motivated, and institutionalized, but it was also very obviously reactionary to the equally horrifying, racially motivated, and institutionalized violence of colonial French society in Saint-Domingue. So I think in any discussion of reparations, the French having ""really good reason to dislike the Haitians"" is kind of a non-starter; its the exact same ""really good reason"" that the Haitians had to dislike the French. So if neither side can claim the moral high ground because of violence committed, then I think it stands to reason that Haiti never should have had to pay any indemnity in the first place.",0.0260517839557539,0.0127151608467102,0.4997346103191376,0.0020415484905242,0,1

post_28,post_28_2_1_1_1,"I agree with you that the debate often boils down in a historically accurate way, especially on the internet, I really do. Even though I disagree with your use of the word genocide, I understand why you're using it (the violence was racialized, it was institutionally sanctioned, it had an exterminatory goal, etc). I think this perspective really only holds up when you remove the post-Revolution reactionary violence from the wider historical context of socially sanctioned violence on the island.

Like, would you call the Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula a genocide? The Christian Kingdoms, particularly Castile, slaughtered and pillaged the Muslim taifas, they carried out numerous pograms against Spanish Jews, they banished Muslims and Jews from the Christian Kingdoms, and they created institutions and cultural norms specifically to identify and murder any that remained in secret. Does this qualify as a genocide, even though the peninsula was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate centuries earlier?

But lets call it a genocide for the sake of your argument:

>the seizure of all land and property in Haiti, coupled with the subsequent genocide, provides at least defensible justification to demand recompense

Would you apply this same logic to indigenous peoples and their relationship to the United States? For sure its a completely different context with different circumstances and historical processes at play, but the use of the word genocide to describe American expansion in the 19th century is quite common, even though some people disagree.

I'm not trying to deflect and change the subject, I think this debate is a really important one-- like which historical injustices warrant recompense, and which do not, if we can come to some consensus around this we stand a chance of really solving a lot of problems. So like I think if we are going to use the word genocide, and if genocidal processes = deserving of recompense, then how do we apply that logic consistently? I guess what I mean is I think there is a contradiction in your argument because on the one hand, the French deserved reparations for the Haitian Revolution, and on the other Haiti deserves none, not just because of the genocide against white French subjects, but because it happened long ago. 

I don't want you to take this as like an attempted gotcha or something, or as a like a morally charged non-sequitur. I think broadening the discussion is useful in this instance.

post_28,post_28_2_1_1_1_1,"I do appreciate the honest engagement :)

I think - and obviously this is just my subjective opinion - that there is something of a statute of limitations on crimes, that generally spans the lifetime of the perpetrators, and that moral imperitives become a bit less set-in-stone when a failure to break them leads to sufficiently bad results.

For the Reconquista, based on just a bit of knowledge, it sounds like the two motivators were ""those against God aren't as 'human'"", which is an absurd but common religious justification, though if you believe in a vengeful God, it's not like we can disprove it. The other being ""these people (Muslims) have and will continue to rule over our land as tyrants if we allow them to stay, so they must all be disposed of"", which is something of a ""we'll do this objectively bad thing because if we don't we'll die"" situation, from their viewpoint. I think there is a big difference between ""people that are X are not welcome here - you must leave or we will kill you"" and ""people that are X are not welcome here, but you *can't* leave, so we can be sure to slaughter you all"", which combined with the desire for self preservation and autonomy of a conquered people makes it a meaningfully different situation than Haiti. Certainly, those participating were no doubt often guilty of unjustified wholesale murder and rape, and if the Moors has the ability, they would have been justified in demanding similar reparations *at the time*, but I don't know of a large systemic campaign to specifically *kill* all Muslims in the region (such a program would of course add further justification for reparations to be paid).

I think for the US, there were a lot of dishonest dealings on the part of the budding nation, but generally were responding to a series of back-and-forth escalations in which both sides could be ascribed some blame. It wasn't fair, and it was deemed reasonable to provide such peoples recompense, in the form of (eventually) the reservation system. A random google search suggests an acre of US land is ~$16k, and 56 million such a acres are reserved for American Indians, which could be viewed as nearly $1 trillion in restitution paid. By 1800 [only 600k](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjdt_665385/2649_665393/202203/t20220302_10647120.html#:~:text=Before%20the%20arrival%20of%20white,237%2C000%2C%20the%20lowest%20in%20history.) such peoples remained in the US, which could be worked out to say we gave each $2m (obviously this ignores those killed or displaced in the pre-revolution era). It was reasonable to provide restitution, and the US did so, all without the willful genocide of the race from the nation.

To sum up my own moral compass for this, as I understand it currently - no son is responsible for the crimes of this father; on death, a person's possessions would first go to making whole those he wronged before being passed to a child, but the responsibility ends there - unpaid recompense doesn't span generational boundaries. If your grandfather murdered mine, it is not on you and all your descendants to eternally be indebted to mine. But institutions aren't people, and governments don't ""die"". When Nazi Germany was defeated, they took on debts that they agreed to repay for the country's misdeeds, even after all the perpetrators has passed away. But the persistence of such obligation only occurs as a results of a promise from the institution, as there isn't an agreed upon higher authority to enforce such responsibilities. They continue to pay because they said they would, but could at any time stop doing so, with potentially serious consequences But that's true of any country, not just Haiti (e.g., if the US decided to set its debt to $0, nobody will send gunboats, but it would possibly lead to the end of the nation due to economic ramifications). And of course every nation everywhere is responsible for deeds that are considered evil through a modern lens. Should not the African nations provide the *most* reparations for slavery, as it was they who actually *enslaved* people in the first place? But nobody is marching through the streets in Angola or Nigeria demanding money be paid to Haitians.

There's also a really grey area of who owes what to whom. Do people who leave a nation retain the responsibilities their nation incurred? Do those immigrating to a nation inherit these responsibilities, despite not having gained any benefit?  It becomes impossible to reasonably divvy up responsibility, or who 'deserves' what.  I think beyond the dubious moral standpoint, there are a lot of practical reasons such payouts could/should not be done.

So the reason Haiti owed what was demanded in the 1820's was because it slaughtered every member of a race/nationality of people on their island in 1804; they were strong-armed to agree to pay it, but there was plentiful moral justification in the French demand. Haiti continued to be obligated to pay it more because they agreed to pay it - and the ramifications for refusing - than because they 'should do the right thing'.",0.1212978296904491,0.0191957354545593,0.4997608661651611,0.0001873970031738,0,0
post_28,post_28_2_1_1_1_1_1,"Yeah I think you're right that two things make this debate incredibly difficult: the fact that it has to be understood intergenerationally, and the fact that it is always tied to national / ethnic identities, which are pretty malleable. 

  
One thing I would point out is this idea of what we inherit -- you can inherit material wealth, which makes a massive difference in your ability to thrive ( I think this applies to both individuals and nations as well, so like the political/social/economic situation 'inherited' by today's French citizens is fundamentally disparate than those inherited by Haitians, and the reasons for that are quite complicated, but also they are historically identifiable and ultimately intelligible. 

I think its good you throw a lot of numbers out, like the effort to a develop quantitative solutions to these kinds of sociopolitical problems is an important avenue, but I think it can only go so far. Like in the Native American example, the land/value calculus is compelling, until you get into the knitty gritty of what land they were given, and what kinds of resources that land/environment allowed (there's a reason why the Trail of Tears led from the fertile southeast to the badlands of Oklahoma area.) But moreover, how do you quantify the damage done to a people, collective and individual, by something like compulsory boarding schools? These institutions were crucial to the destruction of native community and culture, and are [considered ](https://worldwithoutgenocide.org/genocides-and-conflicts/american-indian/indian-boarding-schools#:~:text=In%201969%2C%20a%20Senate%20report,that%20boarding%20schools%20took%20children)a key aspect of why we use the word genocide to describe US expansionism. 

Anyway one thing I think you might find interesting is a [law that was passed in Spain](https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/losangeles/es/Comunicacion/Noticias/Documents/BillGrantingSpanishCitizenship%20(2).pdf) in 2105 that offers citizenship to any descendent of Sephardic Jews who was expelled in the 1500s-- its interesting they do not do the same for Muslims, but then again the pograms against the jews were definitely more akin to genocide than just expulsion. Its an interesting example of citizenship-as-solution to longstanding historically contingent social/political/economic problems.",0.0365185478068647,0.0066843628883361,0.4997288286685943,0.0289939641952514,0,0
post_28,post_28_2_1_1_1_1_1_1,"I think I agree with all of that, with a couple points. I do agree my back-of-the-napkin numbers are less than scientific, and there are a lot of variables that could adjust them one way or another, but trying to arrive at some sort of number allows us to analytically compare situations, which takes a bit of the emotional response out of any judgements. That said, people aren't good at spotting bad stats arguments, so it's too easy to get data supporting a conclusion accepted by people eager demonstrate that conclusion (certainly numerous examples of this in modern times...).

Going back to a brief response, one point is that if your grandfather had an additional $10k, how much would you realistically have today? You could perhaps be up $10k in your bank account today, ignoring siblings' portions and such. It could be that he would have invested it wisely, and you'd be up $50k. But probably, he gets the high shelf whisky for a few months, gets maybe the leather seats on that new car, etc, and the net doesn't affect you at all.

Also if you really look at things too holistically, it muddies the waters further. If American Indians are owed in modern times for wrongs dealt to them in history, do they not owe (or at least have that debt offset) for benefits they gain? If Europeans somehow never found or came to the Americas, presumably the daily life for inhabitants would be today what it was 1000 years ago, as they had already lived on the continent 30k+ years prior.  Would you rather be a native of the region, untouched by foreigners and left to nature, as it was thousands of years ago, or a modern American Indian today, with the various problems and privileges that come with it?  It's easy to watch a documentary and yearn for simpler times, but realistically - life has gotten *really* good for even middle-low income humans in the first world.  

Obviously this sort of logic doesn't work for individual cases of mistreatment, where the victim and perpetrator are still living parties in some dispute, but if we *must* examine 'what was the effect of this group of people, with whom I share some ethnic ancestry, on that group of people, with whom you share some ethnic ancestry' with the goal of deciding 'who owes who what', you would have to look at both sides of the scale. Though even talking about it, I continue to find this ethnic responsibility because of the actions of some ancestors distasteful, and tend to look at people as individuals in pretty much all cases.

One point I think you'll agree with is that well intentioned people - both educated and not - can honestly reach different conclusions. And just because you agree with some premise, it's perfectly okay - and healthy - to argue against bad justifications for that premise. I have in the past been more critical of those arguing for AA in the US, for reasons not unrelated to our above conversation, and thought poorly of everyone that disagreed with me.

post_28,post_28_3,"Philosophically speaking, the argument about reparations really comes down to the extent to which people uninvolved in causing or receiving a harm can be morally involved in that harm. 

Is a modern French taxpayer is in some sense liable for a harm caused by a past French citizen? This is relevant since you could easily have someone born in Haiti move to France and become a French tax payer. You have to believe this individual assumes some liability now for the past harm. 

Similarly, is a modern citizen of Haiti in some sense inherit the status of being the harmed party, even though the specific individuals involved are a long time dead. I’ve read an argument that they in fact do, because we are comfortable accepting that your personal interests can persist after your death - for example, we respect your will and your grave. On that basis we could respect the post death interest of that harmed party in the matter of their descendants. This does require that we are comfortable with the inverse of our above: that is, a French citizen who moves to Haiti and naturalised becomes a recipient of payment from the Haiti born French taxpayer. 

Personally I find the link between modern persons and now dead victims and perpetrators to be too morally tenuous. It’s not clear for example why I, someone raised in Scotland, should not be receiving reparations from modern Italians for the actions of the legions of Rome, purely on the above moral arguments. 

I find a much better moral case that those born fortunate into the developed nations have a moral duty to support less developed nations in the way most suited to reducing suffering and supporting human flourishing.

And there are individuals alive today who benefitted from those payments in a way that is not true for Arab kingdoms.

You're probably right that there is a greater degree of continuity, but both are semi continuous. The Ottoman Empire was the successor state of the various Arab States involved in the Arab slave trade, which Balkanized into various successor states. 

France has undergone significant cultural and population shifts in the intervening years, and the main beneficiaries of Haitian debt were in the aristocratic class which was a vanishingly small proportion of the French population at the time. 

The Reparations for the Haitian Indemnity are not 1:1 with Reparations with the Arab slave trade, but it is in the same ballpark.

Further, the people today that have directly benefited are a lot messier than you think, original payment was made over a period of 5 years and ended in the 1830s. The payments that ended in 1947 were for loans Haiti took out to pay the original indemnity. Many of these loans were from 3rd parties (mostly Americans) that had nothing to do with the original deal. If my mechanic overcharges me on my repair, and I pay it by mortgaging my house, it isn't the bank's fault my mechanic screwed me.

Another thing, the Haitian Indemnity was first proposed by the Haitian President to try to get France to open up diplomatic relations. Countries are not owed recognition or trading rights with another country and the deal that was originally stuck was for the massive indemnity. It was certainly unreasonable of France to demand such a sum, but Haiti didn't have to take that deal. (I'm being a bit reductive here but it's a reddit comment, sue me)

Finally, clearly Haiti needs help right now since they aren't doing so hot.

You could possibly make the case that Turkey is a continuation of the Ottoman empire, but most of the current nations were not separate polities during the time in question, nor do they have continuity (often to the point of departmental records carrying over from republic to republic) in the same way France does, nor are the time frames equivalent. Again, I do not think this is a compelling or insightful comparison given that Haiti exists as an entity over the entire time in question while neither party in the historic Arabian slavery exists as an entity. 

>France has undergone significant cultural and population shifts in the intervening years, and the main beneficiaries of Haitian debt were in the aristocratic class which was a vanishingly small proportion of the French population at the time.

True, but again significantly less so than equivalent comparisons with Arabic nations, and there has been continuity of rule (for the most part) in France for most of Haiti's existence. Shifts in Republic are significant (and I'd agree that Napoleon's government represents a legitimate break in continuity from a moral point of view) but I do not think mitigate the moral responsibility of modern day France (one France shares with a lot of former colonial nations).

>It was certainly unreasonable of France to demand such a sum, but Haiti didn't have to take that deal. (I'm being a bit reductive here but it's a reddit comment, sue me)

I think that one should not absolve a more powerful party of taking advantage of the weaker one on grounds like this. Not taking the deal was a measurable harm to Haiti, and being pressured into a bad deal by a more influential power is morally incorrect regardless. Doubly so given the harm to Haiti and the benefit that France enjoyed, in some cases within a human lifespan. 

>If my mechanic overcharges me on my repair, and I pay it by mortgaging my house, it isn't the bank's fault my mechanic screwed me.

If the funds necessary for the repayment must be sourced from several nations, that simply means the complexity is logistical, not moral. Honestly, the topic of how the US makes amends for centuries of South American policy is one that could fill several volumes, and should be considered separately for simplicity's sake. Fact of the matter is that there is little argument about the moral justice in reparations, only in accountability for who owes them, which indicates the discussion is largely on best how to make amends instead of should amends be made.

>Finally, clearly Haiti needs help right now since they aren't doing so hot...**snip things I agree with**...Haiti is not too far off its coast, and having a failed state so close by is a security concern.

Agreed, it is in both France and the US's interests to have a stable and successful Haiti, as well as (imo) a legitimate moral debt owed by both nations. Unfortunately, neither are great partners in the process, as they tend not to include Haitians in aid efforts, and there is a lot of bad will to overcome.

Overall I agree that it is less, but I do still think it is a reasonable comparison and analogy to make. 

>there has been continuity of rule (for the most part) in France for most of Haiti's existence.

I disagree with this argument. France had massive upheavals of its government and public institutions during the 19th and 20th centuries. My initial point was that modern France and Napoleonic France were two completely different states. One of their only commonalities are the peoples and cultures that live within that state. The people and cultures of the various Arabic states also share peoples and cultures with the historic Caliphates that conducted the slave trade. 

The only similarity historic France shares with modern France are its people and culture, which the same comparison can be made for Arab States. 

>Not taking the deal was a measurable harm to Haiti

Well not exactly. If you want to buy food from me, and I demand an outrageous price, you are not harmed by taking or not taking the deal, even if I'm being an ass by demanding an outrageous price. It's still giving you more options than you had before. 

>indicates the discussion is largely on best how to make amends instead of should amends be made

This is an interesting point, but I'd argue that the logistical challenge of correctly assigning blame for historical events that occurred 200 years ago is folly. Especially for something as complex as involving two entire nations of people. Should the Spanish pay Reparations to Latin America, despite the fact that the current residents of Latin America are almost all descendents of the factions of Spain that directly benefited from its pillage? The descendants of the perpetrators and the victims are the same people. 

While that isn't as much the case for Haiti, a similar complexity does still apply. It's important to note that 800 years ago is the most recent comment ancestor for virtually all humans (other than uncontacted tribes, or other similarly isolationist communities). Just about everyone has had ancestors that were both slaves and slavers. Everyone is descended from victims and perpetrators. 

Certainly some people have had more ancestors that were perpetrators or victims, but my point is that it gets really messy really fast. 

>being pressured into a bad deal by a more influential power is morally incorrect regardless

I don't think moral frameworks are very useful to examine nations through. Nations are not moral actors. Their choices and sense of morality changes with each administration. Especially when they're as murky as reparations for centuries old problems. Instead, I think focusing on helping people and nations that are struggling now is a better use of mental effort and philosophizing. 

Haiti deserves help not because they were victimized 200 years ago, but because they are struggling right now. 

>One thing long term rebuilding programs require is...well long term commitment and a willingness to develop internal partners by demonstrating good faith. Haiti is a tough nut to crack because there's understandable skepticism on the local's part.

I will simply let our disagreement sit, as I think it's tangential to our agreement.

>My initial point was that modern France and Napoleonic France were two completely different states. One of their only commonalities are the peoples and cultures that live within that state. 

I agree there is a discontinuity with Napoleonic France, where a lot of the shittiness happened, but post Napoleonic France still accepted payments, yes? Part of that deal is moral culpability for the debt incurred, in my eyes. They knew what they were getting paid for. I think this is another one where it's okay to differ, since we seem to agree, in large strokes, of the ethical calculus.

> Should the Spanish pay Reparations to Latin America, despite the fact that the current residents of Latin America are almost all descendents of the factions of Spain that directly benefited from its pillage?

Long story short: yes. I happen to think that large scale, voluntary wealth redistribution is in the interests of the developed world for a variety of reasons, from ethical to ecological, and that includes, at the very least, adapting the global economy to serve the needs of the Global South and developing world. If that takes the form of reparations to Haiti (in part) that is fine.

I'm aware that this is a minority position and an unlikely turn of events, so I'll limit myself to the humanitarian and moral arguments here, where I think we sort of agree in principle and disagree on the logistics (which are significant, don't get me wrong).

> It's important to note that 800 years ago is the most recent comment ancestor for virtually all humans (other than uncontacted tribes, or other similarly isolationist communities).

It is less the genetic similarity that is of significance to me, more the (if you can't tell) continuity of behavior and institution, as well as cumulative exploitation (for lack of a better term). In a certain sense (that I believe is relevant here) ""France"" still exists as an entity in such a way that it owes a debt to ""Haiti"" which is a entity that has been in continuous existence and incurring harm. This is of course based on fictions- legal, cultural, historical and geopolitical, but ones that are of consequence regardless.

>Nations are not moral actors. Their choices and sense of morality changes with each administration. 

I agree with you completely on one level: whatever existence a nation has separate from its individual citizens is not ""real"" in the same way a rock or bird or even a photon is. But the idea of a nation is, almost trivially, one that changes the world in ways that the distinction doesn't really matter. Applying moral arguments for nations is a similar type of thing- we're basically participating in a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma and rewarding or punishing cooperation, thus we should act as if nations are capable of moral behavior, both for our own interests and because the constitute members are capable of moral behavior.

Abstract and semantic, admittedly, but useful?

>Haiti deserves help not because they were victimized 200 years ago, but because they are struggling right now.

>post Napoleonic France still accepted payments, yes?

This would be a great point, but France received its last payment in 1888, which is still 2 governments away from the modern French Fourth Republic. You're right that it would seem that each French successor state did take payment until 1888. And you're probably right that if that successor state took payment, they'd have more culpability than if they didn't. 

>Long story short: yes.

I haven't quite decided if I agree with you here or not, but that's besides the point.  I'd wager the reason you feel that way *isn't* because of a historical injustice to those nations, but because they *currently* are significantly less wealthy and prosperous than the current Western States. 

Still even if it was deciding that giving wealth was the correct moral thing to do. There is a giant question on the logistics of such a task so that corrupt governments and corrupt institutions and corrupt individuals are not significantly propped up. Foreign aid often does cause problems to developing nations especially when propped up for significant periods of time. ""Teach a man to fish"" and all that. But that is more beside the point.

post_28,post_28_3_3_1,"France and Britain aren't even the best developed economies per capita in Europe. Your argument seems to require that their status as developed economies depends upon historical exploitation, but that's just ahistorical.

It's quite credible for both governments and populations to argue that they enjoy a developed status today just as much in-spite of their empires than because of it. You could certainly disagree with that, but it then devolves into an empirical question about the extend of current benefit and degree. Generally I find this unsatisfying, since if reparations are \*morally necessary\*, it feels like it should derive from facts about the acts in question, not accidents about how well governed countries happened to be subsequently.

And if the basis is just 'modern persons continue to benefit', then should Arab states pay reparations for the European slave trade that captures and sold millions? If not, why not? Are they not better off than they otherwise would have been if they had not had advanced slave states?

Should British nationals that are the descendants of enslaved peoples also pay into those reparations? They benefit now. Should poor British people pay to wealthy states such as Canada?

In moral philosophy you often take a principal that seems intuitive (such as, it's ok to kill if it saves more lives), and then you test it by looking at cases where that rule seems to fail our intuition. My opinion is that the emotional draw of *being able to correct* the sins of the past is blinding too many people to the contradictions and negative outcomes of the moral principle being espoused.

In this case, I believe reparations are well intentioned but intellectually incoherent.

post_28,post_28_3_5_1,"I think there are quite a few issues with this view, though I acknowledge the emotional appeal. 

It looks at Britain (for sake of example) and says, Britain is wealthier than India (for sake of example) and infers a causal link. From that we say that modern enjoyment of the benefits of historical ills implies some recompense required towards the current descendants of the Indians  impacted. 

Consider the issues:

Firstly, that creates a contingency that we might not like. Many modern states are wealthier than Britain. If I could demonstrate empirically that the empire caused Britain to end up less well off than might otherwise been the case, would we be happy to say Britain owes *nothing* to the world because it didn’t benefit from empire? It feels like moral arguments ought not to depend so continently on empirical facts like this. 

Secondly, it reduces the benefit that British payments to developed countries might have. Many British colonies (eg Canada) are wealthy, many are rapidly becoming superpowers (eg India). British payments to these states would cannibalise funds that could be made available to the very poorest in the world to whom Britain has no colonial link. In a real sense the focus on ‘correcting’ historic issues instead perpetuates issues today instead.  

Thirdly, it creates outcomes we’d likely find unpalatable. For example, do we require payments from modern Arab states to wealthy European states for the Arab slave trade? Certainly these states pass the test of current inhabitants enjoying benefits directly accruing from that trade. Or should modern Italians pay me (a Scot) for the actions of the legions that greatly harmed the inhabitants of then-Scotland (who were then, most likely, wiped out by new incomes that I am more likely descended from)

Fourthly, if we imagine a very great injustice, but whereby the successor state is no longer ‘enjoying the benefits’, does that remove the moral obligation? For example, if Britain was dreadfully mismanaged (not a great stretch of the imagination), it could become much poorer such that no benefit is enjoyed by modern British taxpayers. Does this subsequent mismanagement of their accrued benefit remove the obligation?

And I could go on. I think it’s too morally ambiguous to ever work. We simply cannot fix the past by effort today. 

That’s why I argue a better position is to argue for maximal good today and into the future, instead of a focus on a subset of the sins of the past which are now well past our ability to change",0.0287146450749907,0.0284658074378967,0.4997721016407013,0.0022445917129516,0,0

post_29,post_29_1,"The main issue you are going to run into is that most sources have a bias, and really you can counter that by reading a range of sources. 

There are some that do a better job of it like: 

*Arabs and Jews in Ottoman Palestine: Two Worlds Collide* by Dowty, which is also more recently published. 

He also has a book called *Israel/Palestine* however it was published in 2005 and updated in 2012 with the second edition. Mark Tessler's *A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict* with the second edition coming out in 2009.  

A good book set on the history of Zionism is *The Origins of Zionism* and then, *Zionism: The Formative Years* both by David Vital.

Other books I would suggest:

* *Land and Power: The Zionist Resort to Force, 1881-1948* by Anita Shapira

* *1948* by Benny Morris

* *Righteous Victims* by Benny Morris

* *A History of Palestine* by Kramer

* *Palestine in Transformation* by Scholch

post_30,post_30_3,"It would be nice if there were something like this, but there's a slight problem with the request:

Those examples are usually administrative rules, not ""legislation."" The distinction here is more than semantic, because Presidents have a number of ways to influence policy. 

One is by [signing legislation passed by Congress.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress#Enacted) Presidents can propose legislation, but Congress has no obligation to take it up, draft it or vote on it. That makes legislation quite difficult to pass in a divided government. On the other hand, enacted legislation is the stongest form of policy change, because it cannot be easily reversed, countered or retracted.

Because it's difficult to pass legislation, Presidents use other methods, such as passing [executive orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order) (compiled [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders)) and appointing people to executive branch agencies who will enact [administrative rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_administrative_law) in alignment with administration goals. But sometimes, people who staff those agencies will carry over between admininstrations, so who do you credit the changes to?

Another way a President can affect policy is via the judicial branch. The adminstration, through the office of the [Solicitor General,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States) can sue to challenge the legality of existing rules or to defend rules it has enacted that have been challenged.

The point is, the US has a complex form of government and a deliberate separation of powers, so consolidating all the information about the policy moves of a particular administration into a single page or site isn't a simple matter. Nonetheless, it sounds like a worthwhile project.
