Thank you. 

> The allegation is that members of the IDF carried them out under the orders of the PM and the Defence Minister. Correct?

Depends on their role in the IDF. I imagine some are war criminals themselves independent of the charges levied at the leadership as are militants on the Palestinian side. 

I looked for the details on the requested indictment and [this statement](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-kc-applications-arrest-warrants-situation-state) was the best I found. It didn't seem to differentiate between Netanyahu and Gallant in terms of responsibility for charges, so I'm assuming they're charging both people with all the crimes listed but I could be missing something there. 

I think being insulted by the leader of a country being accused of war crimes is understandable but something, if true, the people will have to come to terms with. Depending on the circumstances it could be impossible for the trigger-puller to have sufficient context to know what they're participating is a war crime. 

It's not a personal moral failing that a random Wehrmacht rifleman who believed his officer when they said they were invading Poland after Polish intrusions into Germany. I think that's a good reason to not generally prosecute such people, and i don't think that's happening. If your unshakable reaction to a leader you served under being accused of war crimes is to deny it I would in that case call it a personal moral failing",0.0288131718311573,0.2123623490333557,0.4997383058071136,0.0016000270843505,0,0

post_2,post_2_7_1_3_1_1_1_1,"Most hardline pro-Israel supporters will probably take decades to, if not never, wake up. They're too heavily invested, emotionally, in the infallibility of the Israeli state.  Israel has been, through pervasive propaganda, been thoroughly intertwined with Jewish identity in the US especially. 

You can see it in their rhetorical strategies, like ""dozens of Arab states, only one Jewish state"" like there's supposed to be some kind of special dispensation where Israel isn't expected to act like a civilized country because it's the only Jewish-majority country in the world. 

You'll see it in the way they say ""The Palestinians have been offered a state and they have refused"" even though it's a categorical lie. The Palestinians signed the Oslo Agreements, which were intended on the creation of a Palestinian-administrated state and an Israeli withdrawal to approximately the 1967 borders.  Israel broke that treaty in less than 4 years during Netanyahu's first term of office.  Every ""peace talks"" since Oslo, Israel has demanded that the Palestinians surrender at least 10% *more* of the West Bank, including when they tried to trade a toxic waste dump in the Negev desert for West Bank farmland, lol. 

But you also have to realize that it's not their fault entirely either.  For as much as non-Jewish Americans have long been taught the ""Israel good, Palestinians Bad"" version of Middle Eastern Mythology through manipulation of media and history textbooks by Israeli lobbyists, it's ten times more through in Hebrew School and Israel. They've been taught false versions of history their entire lives.  You'll get about as accurate a picture of history from them as you would going down to a Trump rally in the Deep South and asking somebody with a red hat to explain the history of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. You have to deliberately go to great effort to learn the true history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and most of them aren't even aware that there would be a reason to. 

I mean, you'll still have people like him pretending that Israel didn't start the 1967 war, claiming it was provoked by a temporary blockade of the Strait of Tiran, even though that blockade was provoked by the unprovoked IDF massacre of Jordanian troops at As Samu. Even the Israelis themselves subsequently admitted that they were in no danger, and just chose to attack. The 1967 war is the whole reason there's still an Israeli-Palestinian conflict today, and it was started by Israel.",0.058329101773388,0.1427297592163086,0.4996304214000702,0.0005429983139038,0,0

>Egyptian intelligence quietly changed the terms of a ceasefire proposal that Israel had already signed off on earlier this month, ultimately scuttling a deal that could have released Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and set a pathway to temporarily end the fighting in Gaza, according to three people familiar with the discussions.

>The ceasefire agreement that Hamas ended up announcing on May 6 was not what the Qataris or the Americans believed had been submitted to Hamas for a potential final review, the sources said.

>The changes made by Egyptian intelligence, the details of which have not been previously reported, led to a wave of anger and recrimination among officials from the US, Qatar and Israel, and left ceasefire talks at an impasse.

>“We were all duped,” one of those sources told CNN.  
  
CIA Director Bill Burns, who has spearheaded the American efforts to broker a ceasefire agreement, was in the region when word reached him that the Egyptians had changed the terms of the deal. Burns was angry and embarrassed, the same person said, believing it made him look like he wasn’t in the loop or hadn’t informed the Israelis of the changes.  
  
The soft-spoken and mild-mannered Burns “almost blew a gasket,” said the source.  
  
A CIA spokesperson declined to comment.  
  
The three sources familiar with the matter told CNN that a senior Egyptian intelligence official named Ahmed Abdel Khalek was responsible for making the changes. Abdel Khalek is a senior deputy to the Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, who has been Burns’ counterpart in leading Egypt’s mediation in the ceasefire talks.  
  
One source familiar with the negotiations said Abdel Khalek told the Israelis one thing and Hamas another. More of Hamas’ demands were inserted into the original framework that Israel had tacitly agreed to in order to secure Hamas’ approval, the source said. But the other mediators were not informed; nor, critically, were the Israelis.  
  
“Hamas was telling their people, ‘We will have a deal in place tomorrow,’” the first source said.  
  
“All sides were under the assumption the Egyptians provided the same document” that Israel had signed off on and the other mediators, the US and Qatar, were aware of, the person said.",0.0389244097459904,0.5708292126655579,0.4997172057628631,0.0013279616832733,0,0

Palestinians haven't been fighting to survive. They've been fighting to destroy the Zionist state. It's different because it's different 

>We have to break out of this mindset where the Israeli right to self-determination is inherent, but the Palestinian right to self-determination must be earned through some indefinite period of subjugation. 

Nope. Palestinians had the chance for immediate self determination at the start of this conflict. They instead sought to deny the Jewish state their own right to self determination. And then waged and took part in many wars of aggression to try and eliminate the Jewish state again and again and again. They've literally never been willing to accept the right of self determination for the Jews of the land

And what had the Jewish state been doing during that time? Well, it offered Palestinians statehood at *multiple different times*. All the way back in 1948, as well as more recently in 2000 at Camp David and even more recently at Annapolis in 2007-8. But each and every time, Palestine refused to accept it. 

After all these wars, all these offers of Palestinian statehood, and all this time where Palestine remains set on the goal of destruction of the Jewish state, it is indeed perfectly reasonable to accept Israeli self determination as a given and the default while requiring far more requirements for a Palestinian state to ever exist.

Didn’t happen. Palestinians were evicted from their villages at gunpoint by the Haganah starting in December of 1947. By May 1948, when Israel declared independence, over 300,000 Arabs had been forced out of the territory where they were promised friendship and coexistence.

That would not have been even remotely fair.

>Didn’t happen. Palestinians were evicted from their villages at gunpoint by the Haganah starting in December of 1947. By May 1948, when Israel declared independence, over 300,000 Arabs had been forced out of the territory where they were promised friendship and coexistence.

The majority of the Arabs who left Jewish controlled territory left voluntarily, leaving because they did not want to live under Jewish rule. There were some isolated incidents, largely by more fringe paramilitaries like Irgun rather than Haganah, that did indeed involve violence and force, and that was bad (as was the incidents of violence and force in the other direction).

Just like what Israel did to the Arabs who were promised equality under the law in the 1947 partition agreement, right? Oh wait, that didn’t work out did it?

>  just like what happened in every single Arab country in the region

You mean, what happened AFTER Israel expelled 700,000 Arabs from their homes?

Again, telling one side of a story lets you paint whoever you like as monsters.

> The majority of the Arabs who left Jewish controlled territory left voluntarily, leaving because they did not want to live under Jewish rule. 

This is a myth. The premier Israeli historians, Benny Morris and Ilan Pappe, confirmed from Israel’s military archives that the majority were expelled by force. Regardless, force was used to prevent evacuated civilians from returning to their homes. 

You might be tempted to call this a lie of course, but stop and think: isn’t civilians evacuating a good thing? So, even if you were right about them leaving voluntarily… why couldn’t they return once the active conflict ended? They had a right to, didn’t they? Then when their homes were confiscated by the Israeli state, that was theft… right?

> There were some isolated incidents, largely by more fringe paramilitaries like Irgun rather than Haganah, that did indeed involve violence and force, and that was bad

And the perpetrators punished? And the victims compensated and allowed to return? You’ll find the answer to both is “no.”

That's nonsense, and as long as Palestinians cling to that idea, they will never get anything.

The idea that they didn't have some claim to the land in 1948 makes no sense, if anything they had more claim in some ways.

Great. I've gotten the feeling that we are headed in this direction.

On this narrow point: the fact that Hamas's multimillion-dollar tunnel system (funded by Iran) would enable it to reenter and operate in IDF area was well known and considered an acceptable risk. Even without tunnel systems, insurgencies have been known to reenter opposing territory to conduct ambushes, but especially the Hamas tunnel system was always understood to pose this risk. 


I don't think Netanyahu has a solid strategy, so I don't disagree with that point, but the reentry of Hamas fighters into IDF-controlled areas like Northern Gaza isn't very good evidence of that claim. In fact, using the tunnel systems to enter Israel itself and abduct people has been a consistent Hamas policy for years (this was how they got Gilad Shalit, for example).


There are a number of articles about the tunnel system, so I'll paste a few:

Israel’s leadership just threw a fit over the delay of a single shipment of bombs over humanitarian concerns, and is throwing another over an international court warrant.

That isn’t a very good analysis of Israeli-Chinese relations. The fact is, China can’t cozy up to Israel too much while maintaining close ties with Iran - and Iran supplies 10% of chinas oil and gas, with billions in Chinese investments in their petroleum industry. 

> Sometimes loans are roads, sometimes loans are bridges, sometimes loans are energy infrastructure, and they can absolutely be weapons.

And again, Israel’s military uses NATO gear. If they want to switch over to Chinese supplied systems that will take decades. Israel isn’t sub Saharan Africa - they don’t need help building bridges or roads, and they definitely don’t want the terms of Chinese infrastructure loans. 
> I don’t see it likely that the US would participate in sanctions period

This isn’t a serious answer. The countries that want to see Israel sanctioned aren’t America, and China does care what the international community thinks. China does practice diplomacy, believe it or not lol. Poking a finger in Americas eye by winning Israel over is not worth the cost - and the same end could be accomplished by humiliating Americas pet “western imperialist colony stage” or whatever they’re calling Israel.

You could say that Israel “needs” military support, in the sense that the region would likely erupt in war without it. I honestly suspect that Israel would win such a conflict with even modest assistance from China in the form of munitions though.

If you can demonstrate something more than conjecture here, be my guest. An expert in regional politics that agrees with your position? Just curious.

Vastly overstated.  The US maintains no significant bases in Israel, and aside from some HumInt from Mossad, there's very little in the matter of two-way participation in regional security.  Israel is actually more of a handicap than anything else, as seen by their unilateral strikes on Iranian officials in Syria back in April.

post_2,post_2_19_1_1,"According to all the reporting he's just an extreme hardliner.

During a 1992 speech to AIPAC, Biden again voiced support for Israel that made some of its strongest backers uncomfortable. Biden started out by saying that he didn’t think any senator had “ever done more fundraisers for AIPAC,” a group whose supporters were key backers of his 1988 presidential campaign. He then worked himself up to the point where he was shouting and beating his chest for emotional effect as he lambasted an unprecedented public campaign by George H.W. Bush to push Israel toward engaging with Palestinians’ demands for sovereignty and an end to the Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and other territory seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

At the time, Bush was demanding that Israel stop building settlements in occupied territory in violation of international law if it wanted to receive billions of dollars in loan guarantees from the United States to support the arrival of Soviet Jews. He knew that groups like AIPAC considered this to be an affront, but he believed his actions were necessary to advance peace talks. Biden was far from the only member of Congress who opposed Bush, but he did so with uncommon fervor.

Articles in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs noted that some listeners “squirmed with embarrassment” as Biden ranted about how the issue of American aid for Israel had become “susceptible to demagoguery.” “You know, no one should take Biden seriously here. He is a cheerleader,” one attendee said. “He helps us, of course, but does opposing the peace talks or ignoring them or disparaging them really make sense? I don’t think so.”

The most revealing part of the AIPAC speech was Biden’s explanation of what remain the two pillars of his approach to Israel and Palestine. First, he told the audience that he kept his criticism of things like settlements, which he opposed, between him and Israel. Second, he made sure the two nations maintained a united front so that “the Arabs” would bend. These beliefs explained his disgust with what he considered to be a destined-to-fail effort by Bush to exert leverage over Israel and its right-wing prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir.

As an european who is lucky enough to have the choice between a few left wing parties that's something that always pops in my head when American leftists are being attacked for saying that they won't vote for Biden.

If I'm not happy with my preferred left wing party's policies I have the ability to vote for another one and I can pressure them by doing that without fearing that I will help my country's fascists (even though it doesn't matter anyway since the plurality of our voters do support those, but whatever). 

But if I was an american I wouldn't have that choice, so my only leverage would be the threat of not voting at all. And I'm pretty sure that I **would** use that leverage even if I likely would vote for the 'lesser evil' in the end anyway. 

With all that said my point is: I find it quite likely that a large part of the americans who are talking about not voting for Biden right now **will** vote for him in November but they are absolutely right in pressuring him with the possibility of not voting for him. And I think the fact that so many are using these tactics right now is more a sign of how bad a winner-takes-all voting system is than a sign of how 'dumb American leftists are'.

To me, it just clearly does, as it states that the Genocide is happening because of Biden, that's how I interpret the slogan, and I figure that is how a lot of people interpret it. As though having a different president would make the genocide stop, which feels very unlikely.

> I don't think College student chanting about how America as a whole is evil and complicit in genocide would be much better received than the ""Genocide Joe"" stuff, but it's impossible to test

Maybe it wouldn't, but I would receive it better at least. I'm probably a very specific minority. But ultimately I love the protests and am glad they are happening/find the repression of them disgusting and really concerning. I just disagree with a few slogans they use.

> That seems contradictory. Isn't worsening his election chances exactly the leverage that protesters have? If Biden were up 20 points and Trump was being sentenced to a third life sentence Biden would have no reason to consider the wishes of activists in hope of getting their votes.

Yes and no. Sure that is their biggest piece of leverage, but I think they are misusing it, because a trump election would be worse for Palestine and everyone else. I could be right, but I see the Genocide Joe slogan as making it hard for Biden to be elected, and also not helping change US policy towards Gaza. Protests as a whole can make a difference in US policy, but I fail to see how that slogan helps change US policy.

It is all a balancing curve to me. Changing US policy on Gaza and getting Biden reelected are both very important.

That's the point in some respects. That if Biden believes that protests will hurt his re-election chances he will change policy in response to that in hopes those people will vote for him. That is balanced by people on the other end who are happy with Biden and will choose to vote against him if he changes course.

You are probably right here, but part of it is that for the most part I'm not going to go around complaining about a slogan, when there is an ethnic cleansing going on (I'm doing it now but that's because someone else started it and I figured its better to hear other peoples opinion). 

I'm for the most part a moderate on I/P in that I want a two state solution, but since Netanyahu seems to be making that impossible, then I'll take a one state called Country with a language called Language.

I don't know electorally what would be best for Biden.

If Biden believed that becoming more anti-Israel was the thing that would win him the election but chose not to because some of the people who wanted that thing were mean to him then he has the emotional intelligence of a toaster and probably should retire. 

Also, if you believe a genocide is occurring what benefit do you get from avoiding the accusation? I don't think it makes sense to downplay the severity of what you think is occurring. It being genocidal is what makes the claim so serious. It's like avoiding using the word ""kill"" when watching a cop choke a guy to death on the street.

It’s pretty difficult to understand this decision. The election is between Israel’s biggest cheerleader in the Democratic Party, and the man who called neonazis “very fine people.” Even if Biden took a 180 on Israel, Trump is still the worse choice for Jewish Americans, for the simple fact that his base includes 99% of the people who wish Jewish Americans harm.

post_6,post_6_0,"The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.

The state of Ohio, among possibly others, is denying Biden from being on the presidential ballot because the Democratic Convention is technically beyond the date at which state law says a candidate can be certified. Past Republican and Democratic conventions have also violated this law, but were ""waived"" in some way to allow balloting. I'm not sure if those past waivers were official acts, or something that falls more into a grey area of discretion. 

Either way, this is predictably outrageous, morally if nothing else. But many fellow liberals seem to think Biden should act/sue over this violation. I'm not really sure I agree that there is a case. It's more like the opposite of a violation. They *stopped allowing* violation at a strategic moment of harm. It's not really the same thing.

The constitutionality of these restrictions is dubious, and a court would be highly inclined to find a way to get Biden on the ballot whereas courts are rather quiescent when it comes to Joe Exotic's inability to get on the ballot.

There is nothing Trump can say or do, other than going against the alt-right populist grain, that will change the minds of conservatives and radical centrists. I think we're way beyond the point of questionable messaging poisoning his brand. 

The only hope to really dissuade some of the centrists from voting for him is if he gets convicted for a fairly straightforward offense and serves some sort of sentence.

Furthermore, the Democratic Party rank and file has little to do with the decisions of state SoSs.

Anyway, I don't fully agree with this comment, but you're highlighting the wrong part. ""No person who shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against \[the U.S. Constitution\], or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof"" doesn't say what the standard is, it doesn't demand a conviction. I don't think it makes much sense to complain about someone reasoning it doesn't require a conviction, either. Compare it to the thirteenth amendment: 

>>Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime **whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction

The same people who passed the fourteenth amendment without a demand for a criminal convictiondemanded a criminal conviction in the thirteenth, they didn't just find it unnecessary to write the word ""convicted"" when they meant it.

The opinion in Trump v. Anderson, which is how Anderson v. Griswold went to the Supreme Court after some things I'm not knowledgeable on, doesn't claim the 14th amendment demands a criminal conviction or criminal charges, either - it only claims section 3 of the 14th amendment requires enacting legislation by Congress (if I understood it correctly).

What? No. No one even considered canceling any elections, the thing that happened was one candidate being denied a place on the primary ballot because he appeared to be ineligible. Not in a unilateral decision, but due to a lawsuit because the Democratic-led Colorado Department of State decided to put Trump on the Republican primary ballot.



>The only thing that actually stopped you all from already doing that this year 


Doing what this year?

I'm not surprised you're certain you know what people believe better than those people. Aid or comfort requires you to actually do something or at least make a significant decision regarding the thing you're providing, what you're claiming would in fact be beneath the pale

First of all, I never said anything about what they believe. I'm talking about what they would do and say. Second, why are you not surprised I think I know what people think? Is that a personal comment?

I'm merely saying that their actions so far point in a definite direction. And as a reminder, what I said is what most independents believe, at this point. Which is why we identify a second Biden presidency as a threat to democracy more than a second Trump presidency, [by a double-digit margin.](https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202404261555.pdf) (At *least.* That's an *NPR* poll.)

Well, then we should start there, shouldn't we? 


You complained some redditor said ""Section three of the fourteenth amendment doesn't demand criminal conviction, not criminal charges"" while that was the position backed by precedent. But that's just a true statement - if the writers of the fourteenth amendment had wanted to write ""convicted"" there, they would have, just like they did in the thirteenth amendment. That's the part of the comment you emphasized, not ""there is no doubt Trump gave aid or comfort"", which there can be much controversy over, and which you then shifted gears to exaggerating.

""As opposed to a Congressional vote"" is a weird framing. As opposed to a factual finding in the administrative process putting someone on a ballot is (just like the factual finding that a candidate got enough signatures), for instance, not just to something even more complicated.

I personally? Interesting


>need there to be a conviction, or a trial, or charges, or any process at all  


I don't think there ""[needn't be] any process at all"" for any executive decision. Moreover, there also needs to be a process to challenge such a decision - a process that exists, see: Anderson v. Griswold. The thing that kicked this off


>beyond just a Democratic state official declaring a Republican guilty 


Not guilty, but engaged in insurrection or rebellion



>and banning by fiat 


Again, I don't think any executive decision should be by fiat. It should all only be an exercise of discretion limited by law, and susceptible to review by administrative courts (which are just the normal courts in the US, I believe) 


>(as happened in Maine, which that comment was discussing) 


The state SoS just decided without a hearing, and without laws ruling her decision, to take Trump off the ballot? That would be bad, if it happened. Maybe the US should get a universal voting rights amendment to combat that, if it were true that is.

The Supreme Court (not 'Radical Republicans') has ruled unanimously that it doesn't mean that, insofar as it can't be used by states that way.

And that amendment you're using was written for a Civil War, intended to be used against people who had actually taken up arms against the government in a war that killed half a million Americans and devastated countless cities, and **even on that occasion,** mass pardons eventually made it explicitly inapplicable to the vast majority of those uniformed insurrectionists, **to say nothing of** those who gave them 'aid and comfort.'

Interesting scare quotes. If you want to complain about the term ""Radical Republicans"" for a political faction of the 19th century, I'm willing to choose another term. Do you have any suggestions?

>has ruled unanimously that it doesn't mean that, insofar as it can't be used by states that way

And four is prime, insofar as it cannot be divided by an odd number greater than one. (The decision is per curiam, by the way - claiming it's unanimous is speculation)

>And that amendment you're using was written for a Civil War

It was written because of a Civil War, it is not restricted to one.

>intended to be used against people who had actually taken up arms against the government in a war that killed half a million Americans and devastated countless cities

Despite what your phrasing implies, that's not the criteria. It was intended to be used against people who had ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the Constitution, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof"", after swearing an oath to protect it. You need to be an oath-breaker for it to apply, but you don't need a civil war, nor a minimum death toll of 500,000. The Confederates were a reason for this amendment, but they were not all it encompasses

>and **even on that occasion,** mass pardons eventually made it explicitly inapplicable to the vast majority of those uniformed insurrectionists

I think the term is ""amnesty"" when a legislature does it

It’s obvious that the toxicity of our politics regards not only the methods of our discourse, but also the policies being debated, the methods for achieving power, and the way the dispute is resolved.

post_8,post_8_15_1_4_1_1_1_1_2,"The alternative to ""Great Man Theory"" is an approach that focuses on larger sociological, economic, and cultural forces. Its sometimes called  ""History from Below"", as well as specific names for specific approaches.

Instead of focusing on Franklin or Washington, this approach would focus on how economic forces encouraged thr colonists for seeking independence from Britain, or how decades of skirmishes with Native Tribes led to a focus on hit-and-run tactics early in the war, or on expectations of ""manly conduct"" during war. The focus is less on individual people overall, at any level.

If I were making a Revolutionary War movie with a ""History from below"", focus here's how I'd do it:
Johnny is a young man in Boston. His father runs a modest shipping business that's being squeezed by British taxes. Johnny tangles with Loyalists on the streets of Boston, and ends witnessing the Boston Massacre. He is loyalty is torn because his cousin Billy is a Loyalist, but he ends up joining the Sons of Liberty. He partakes in the Boston Tea Party.

When the war breaks out, Johnny wants to join up, but his father, a Quaker, doesn't believe war is right and this leads to a rift between them. Johnny joins up anyway and we see some failed early skirmishes until his unit is whipped into shape. The climax is Johnny fighting at Bunker Hill, showing his patriotism and bravery.

So as a sequel to my last thread, I would like to throw in other failed Democratic candidates, two of whom faced off against the same opponent earlier and one in an entirely new election after the second term of the ruling party's predecessor, and so I will ask the following questions:  
1) Who was the weaker Democratic candidate between Hubert Humphrey and Jimmy Carter and why?  
2) Who was the weaker Democratic candidate between Jimmy Carter and Michael Dukakis and why?  
3) Who was the weaker Democratic candidate between Michael Dukakis and Hubert Humphrey and why?  
4) If you had to rank from strongest to weakest between three?  
Bonus Questions:  
a) How well do you think Hubert Humphrey would have done if he faced off against Ronald Reagan in 1980 and George HW Bush in 1988 compared to Carter and Dukakis respectively and why?  
b) How well do you think Jimmy Carter would have done if he faced off against George HW Bush in 1988 and Richard Nixon in 1968 compared to Dukakis and Humphrey respectively and why?  
c) How well do you think Michael Dukakis would have done if he faced off against Richard Nixon in 1968 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 compared to Humphrey and Carter and why?

d) How strong or weak do you think Humphrey, Carter, and Dukakis were compared to Adlai Stevenson II, George McGovern, and Walter Mondale?

FYI: Your information on this is about a generation behind.

The empirical revolution changed the fundamentals of the field, steering it away from theory, and making it less *soft* of a science. The ideological claims about those theories fell apart around that same time, probably because the theories were being disproven.

For example, in 1990 an economist would tell you that the minimum wage is a price floor, and we should expect it to create inefficiencies like other price floors. In 2015 an economist would tell you that the had studied the actual data and proven the opposite, arguing that the theory needs to be updated as it was not borne out by experimentation.

I don't think you understand why climate change is already a major EU problem and why it will continue to get worse. You just seem to like aethestics more than reality. Your stated positions make the EU weaker while creating a mythologized idea of Europe instead of actually creating a better and stronger and safer Europe.

Great but that's not what you said that I was asking about. Nor how you cam make the EU or even just France  less suseptible to commodity price raising even if you have internal production enough to met domestic needs. The Russian invasion of Ukraine spiked food prices across the world because of commodity pricing even effects markets that don't import ukrianian grains. Like how the US has enough petrol production to satisfy all domestic needs, but the Saudis independently cutting back production still means Americans are paying more and creates perverse political incentives to appease Saudi Arabia.

Ok? Stabilizing is what solving climate change means at bare minimum. I'm not sure why you seem to think differently.

>If you produce enough grain internally (if the French ever learn to work, but that's another story ;) ), you can cut off Ukrainian/Russian import to counter them. It would effectively stop further inflation if stability is guaranteed through such a system.

I'm sorry you are just incorrect. That's not how commodities like grain work. 

Especially since France is one of the few states that is already producing enough food for itself and we already see how that doesn't protect against pricing being effected negatively by global affairs.

>Try the same with the Saudi's. Cut them off if they're too busy filling their own pockets.

That doesnt change that their production still effect global commodity pricing and thus domestic pricing. The USA barely imports Saudi oil at al currently and we are still massively effected by Saudi production. 

Never mind that there are about hundred countries including the majority in Europe who simply can not possibly become oil and gas self sufficient because they have no access to sources, the same with grain. There is only so much farmland and so much food that can be produced on that land. France is already fine in that regard but most of Europe isn't. 

>The politician that does that, would end in a lake downstream, but the truth is that reducing these ties would help them

Considering the massive investments in climate change stabilization directly combats the oil demand that Saudi relies on that seems like an uninformed statement. The US and EU are directly combating their addiction to oil already but that seems to be against what you want given that a major effect of the Paris agreements you want out of.

>If you guys elect Trump, we'll have no other option than to be independent.

France is independent already.

My opinion is that the government shouldn't do a lot for the climate change, and instead focus on domestic issues. We've had an inflation of 12% (with food inflation going to 17%) thanks to the Ukrainian War, and I think we should prevent that.  

It's one of the reasons why I've gone from ""no government intervention"" to ""limited government intervention"".  We should promote our local industries over the international, and will indirectly help climate change. But that's where it ends, as I believe a country, as small as we are, can not make a real ecological difference. 

*Example given for an opinion:*

We should invest in nuclear energy (one of our biggest mistakes was to sell Electrabel to the French Suez thanks to Verhofstadt; The produced electricity should've been privatized but not to one, foreign company. That's subsidized monopoly and should be prevented at all costs.) and into research toward  nuclear fission.

They agree to not intervene until it directly affects them. There hasn't been any government that did not intervene somewhere in the economy. You may correct if I'm wrong.

We may be glad that the US has evolved away from the cheap, sweatshop-like labor. But that doesn't mean it's disappeared.

However, they never expect the same from anyone else, or have a lower opinion of them. If they see a name that's new to them but cultural, they want to pronounce it right. They would never correct anyone on the pronunciation of their name. Americans cringe at being American and the culture we have when we step away from our keyboards but it's just as valid as any other, but they pridefully expect Americans to be these superior people while expecting nothing of anyone else, because they secretly don't think they're capable.

I even see it with politics. Many on the left don't see borders. In our country, we should already accept every path of sexuality that exists. But outside our borders?

Shooting and hunting can be fun hobbies. If you’re not into that, cool. But making those specific weapons, certain types of weapons, or all weapons illegal will do nothing. It’ll just bring the prices up on a black market. People will still get them. For the record, I support background checks. But this will turn into nothing but something akin to the war on drugs.

Hi everyone,

I've been thinking about the ""adopt vs shop"" debate for pet owners and I'm curious to hear your thoughts. When do you think it’s acceptable to ""buy"" a puppy or kitten? For instance, if all the shelters in your area were empty and had a wait list, would it be okay to go to a breeder? Or, imagine if the US government outlawed the breeding of dogs and cats – would people have to wait for a stray to show up with a litter?

I’m leaning ""Team Adopt,"" but I'm wondering at what point buying might become a consideration for me.

I'm trying to get an idea of what the future would look like if all dog/cat breeding were outlawed, and then these animals were given extinction risk protection by various federal wildlife agencies.. like how far are we going with this?

What if there was an adoption agency that specifically worked directly with breeders, and facilitated direct from breeder adoptions of purebred dogs/cats?

For instance.  A breeder has a female Goldendoodle.  Its 3 years old and had 2 litters. The breeder wants to retire the Goldendoodle, but doesn't want it to go to a shelter (wants to know that its future family will care for it and send updates).

post_12,post_12_7,"With respect to dogs, (and because I care about cats about as much as they care about me...) I'm leery of adoption.   Dogs are just bundles of empathic energy... and a dog that's been abused, abandoned and/or just  plain had a bad/clueless owner is going to be more effort.  Bad habits, anxiety, willfulness, having had no discipline, or the wrong kind of discipline, etc, takes time and resources to overcome.  It breaks my heart to say no to that, because those are the dogs that need love and training the most, but I don't feel capable of properly giving it.  I like the idea of getting a puppy immediately after weaning, start training right from day one and developing a bond with it without any intervening owners having bonded or given it bad habits or the wrong kind of discipline.

On the other hand, getting a dog from a breeder is a whole other kind of hassle.     I was looking to get a boxer, pre-covid, and trying to find a breeder that didn't dock the tails and/or the ears was nigh on impossible.  It is a ridiculous and cruel standard of breeding and I don't think any dog ought be deprived of its tail or have its ears reduced.   My living situation changed when covid hit, and suddenly I didn't have the space to have a dog, so I'm glad I didn't get one.    But I'm rebuilding and maybe sometime soon can find a boxer or two to bring into the family. 

  
The other thing to think about is the possibility that the dog you adopt from the shelter might have been a breeders dog whose previous owner just didn't know what they were doing or ended up in the shelter through a possibly bizarre set of circumstances.

post_12,post_12_10,"I do some volunteer work with shelters and rescues. Here's my perspective:

Shopping is toxic under pretty much every modern circumstance. There are too many animals, the breeders are exploitative/badly regulated/cruel, etc., the costs of buying are huge compared to adopting, people who are not disciplined enough to go through an process probably purchase a decade+ commitment. The hyper-bred dogs have all kinds of bonus, costly health issues as well. And, even worse, the breeders constantly dump unsold ""inventory"" into the wild, increasing the need for adoptions or just creating food for the coyotes.

Plus, there is just too much need for adoptions. Animals often outlive their circumstances and need somewhere to go. They don't die just because their owner died or has to move to another country or whatever.

And if you're not sure about it, sign up to be a foster. You'll get to be a little picky, they usually give you free supplies/food/etc., and you get to ""test drive"" the animal to see if it's a good match. If not, it will get adopted and you can try another one. Make friends with the people who run the shelter and, if it turns out you were looking for some specific kind of dog, you'll be the first person to get the call for it.

---

Sure, if your hypotheticals came true, maybe there are rare circumstances where you'd be in a situation where adoptions weren't available. But we are not anywhere near outlawing breeding or anything like that for pets. And the shelters are nowhere near empty. They only had a real shortage when Covid happened and everyone suddenly wanted a pet. After Covid, *plenty* of those animals were returned or dumped.

Obviously, a lot of the rescue animals are ""suboptimal"" (most people want cute babies/youth in specific breeds or colors... so that can be fairly hard to accommodate in a pure adoption situation). Lots of animals are older, may have some behavior issues, lack training, etc. - but most of those will be overcome by a good home... and shelters are understanding when someone adopts a pet and is overwhelmed by the issues that come with it.

I don't think that possible health issues is a reason not to buy a dog from a breeder, but if you are a first time dog owner, you might want to hedge your bets with a dog that is less at-risk.

But in this instance, the (Jewish) student asked if the Jewish community still bears the scars of the Holocaust. Shapiro agreed that it does. The student asked if the Holocaust and its legacy informed the Jewish community on how to interact with the world at large. Shapiro agreed that it did.

 The student then asked if the black American community still bears the scars of segregation, which ended twenty years after the Holocaust. Shapiro gave a dumbfounded ""well, uh…"" The student pressed with ""wouldn't it stand to reason that the legacy of segregation would continue to affect the black community like the legacy of the Holocaust affects ours when segregation ended twenty years later and lasted twenty times longer?"" Shapiro had no answer and moved on to the next question, giving a noncommittal ""I'll have to think about that, thank you for your question.""

That was in 2013. Eleven years on, I have yet to hear him circle back to that. But he sure as hell continues to suggest that the black community should buck up and move on.

post_13,post_13_2_2_2,"So an example of this was a more recent one.  Now Ben Shapiro really only actually engages in debates with college kids because they are easy prey to him and he can usually spout a few stats he has memorized that roughly apply to the situation, the college kid doesn't know any stats by heart, and Ben gets to pretend he's smart.  

(it actually funnily goes back to the American Nazi party and how they started giving talks on college campuses because it was the only place that ""Free speech"" was still present and most other places refused to hold them.  Ironic how that works huh?)

But!  Kid stands up and asks Ben about his feelings about gay marriage.  Ben explains that gay marriage isn't right because a gay couple can't conceive a child and that's the point of marriage.  That's Ben's usual ""Gotcha!"" answer because he always ends it there with a simple biology fact and gets to be smug.  This time the kid asks Ben the follow up of will he get a divorce when Ben's kids grow up and move out, since his job as a parent is effectively done at that point.  It stunlocked Ben and he moved on to the next question.  

Now ironically, because this is the kind of person Ben is, he since had an individual 1 on 1 (Months later when he had time to stew on the question), he had another kid ask the exact same question, and he could answer about how the parental relationship goes on past the kid leaving and therefore it's acceptable to stay married because he's still a parent even if the kid doesn't live at home.

That's Ben's style.  He knows his stats and gotcha answers to the ""Common"" questions, if he gets caught out, he moves on so he can't possibly be wrong, then goes back later to film a video about how he now knows how to continue to prove his point and puts it up so that when you google it, you find his nice clean version and not the original.",0.1420009505389528,0.0158694386482238,0.4996860921382904,0.0001002848148345,0,1

a common example is using arguments they don't actually believe in or care about. if you claim to believe X because of Y, and then i make arguments against Y that you have no answer to, that should weaken your belief in X at least a little bit, you shouldn't immediately move on to ""well actually, i believe X because of Z"" and completely ignore the arguments i just made.

if you dislike immigrants, especially those with dark skin, don't pretend it's only about illegal immigrants. if you think trans people are mentally ill degenerates, don't pretend you only want to ""protect the children"". if you keep proposing laws that would make it more difficult for black people to vote, don't pretend it's about ""election security"". especially if you then reject any law that would actually make elections more secure.

post_13,post_13_19,"I think an argument is bad faith when it's not entered into in the understanding of personal fallibility, when it's misrepresented, or when the argument comes from a place of ideology, not being even considered to be subject to challenge.

A good faith argument is one that is entered in to in the spirit of better getting at truth or understanding. A good faith argument could, for example, be one that I'm willing to give up if confronted with a counterargument I can't refute. Or I could, while expressing my opinion, be engaged in a good faith endeavor of simply trying to understand where my interlocutor is coming from.

When I argue because I'm emotionally attached to some idea and there's nothing that can be said to dispossess me of that ideology, that's not arguing in good faith. That's rather preaching something I see as being indisputable.

When I misrepresent my beliefs as a means of proving them, this is also a way of arguing in bad faith. You see this in racist concern trolling all the time (example below).

When I instead approach discourse honestly, as a means of testing my beliefs, and I'm open to having my mind changed, or at least conceding to a point I cannot refute, that is arguing in good faith.

**Examples:**

***1. Not entered into in the understanding of personal fallibility:*** ""Vaccines are wrong because they don't make sense to me. I don't care what you say.""

***2. When it's misrepresented:*** ""I'm the furthest thing in the world from a racist. I just want to help *\[maligned group\].* Maybe they're poor because they're stupid. This means their parents should not all be out doing illegal stuff but at home educating the kids. But the idea that racism exists is just *\[maligned group\]* trying to play the race card to get ahead. I mean I really care about people-- you can ask anyone in my klan-- but I'm sick of hearing about *\[maligned group\]* thinking they have it so bad. What about *\[privileged group\]?* We're not all rich and we don't get in any trouble because \[we're basically intrinsically better\].""

***3. Arguing from ideology:*** ""I just wanna know why you non-believers are so intent on going to hell; I don't wanna get into religion, you don't understand any of that anyway, I just wanna know why you love hell so much.""

As for how we can know-- while sometimes it's pretty obvious-- we admittedly can't always know at first. But, engaging with people, we can know very quickly whether they approach discourse in good faith. Can they, for example concede a point? Can they refute a point without anger or personal attacks?

A person coming in with “oh yeah science? If evolution is real, why are there monkeys?” is clearly not coming in with that mindset, and that’s bad faith, or else the person in question has been very seriously down in their schooling in terms of what evolution is but also what monkeys are and maybe even what real means.

Also either not responding to the entirety of points, conveniently ignoring large swathes of things people have written because it’s inconvenient to the point they want to make, responding to linked evidence with feelings and/or dismissing linked evidence for no other reason than ‘I don’t like it’ or ‘I don’t want to believe it’, or otherwise twisting the meaning of something someone has said to be uncharitable, taking things out of context, or deliberately being obtuse. Also just being interested in winning above actually coming to an understanding.

An example of a bad faith argument would be:

Commenter: Here’s a handful of different examples from different states that implemented voter ID laws only for said laws to be struck down as unconstitutional, or to otherwise have ended up only serving to disenfranchise the vote from certain demographics

Bad faith commenter: it’s racist to assume people are too stupid to get an ID.

Bad faith, to me, is also people who are able to think critically about something but who deliberately don’t or won’t about the argument they’re trying to prosecute because it would make the argument fall apart. Such examples would be things like: ‘Bill Clinton is a pedophile because he was friends with Epstein but Trump isn’t a pedophile despite also being friends with Epstein’ or ‘Joe Biden is a criminal despite no, or specious, evidence but Trump’s documented crimes that have plenty of evidence behind them and that he has no real defense for are not crimes because there’s no specific victim’

The reason conservatives often argue in bad faith is that modern conservatism is built on fear and so is by definition bad faith. 

Liberals can still, obviously, argue in bad faith. It’s just that ‘we must have guns because freedom’ or ‘the real racism is against white people’ and plenty of the other dominant lines in conservative circles are built on bad faith.",0.0941749419191909,0.0076124668121337,0.4997543096542358,4.827976226806641e-06,0,1

People talk about Trump trying to seize power in the 2020 election, that he wants to be a dictator, but all I ever see them reference is inciting the riot/insurrection on January 6. That was pretty messed up, but it could be argued in court that he did t specifically try to stop the election. 

However, the [fake elector plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot) was such a blatant attempt to steal the election, and he was more obviously and directly involved. It was undeniable election fraud on an incredible scale, seven key states in a presidential election. He has been indicted, and he is arguing he should be immune, but it seems to get little to no attention, at least in my circles on Reddit and in life. It seems so damning.

When people are trying to explain why Trump is treasonous, or has aims to be a dictator, or is wrong about Democrats cheating the election, why isn’t this always the first piece of evidence? Why, unlike 1/6, do I never hear about it?

post_14,post_14_17,"As others have said the so called plot is complicated. But it’s not just about what resonates with people, it’s also about what’s prosecutable. 


Because the way it works is - Republicans chose their electors before the elections. Democrats chose their electors before the elections. The fact that Republican and Democrat electors both exist - is not illegal. 


It’s also not illegal that said Republican and Democrat electors are on “standby”. I mean, that’s what they do in a normal election when everything is proper. 


What is illegal is sending a fake Certificate of Ascertainment to the Senate and to the Archivist - stating that you party’s Electors won and they elect so and so, if in fact your party did not get the majority / plurality vote. 


If you look at those that have already been successfully prosecuted with regards to this - they have all been charged with some variation of forgery, falsifying documents and conspiracy to do so. 


The thing is - Trump didn’t actually forge or falsify anything. What he did was hear about the scheme from Eastman and what he did was claim there was election fraud. 


That’s a big leap from hearing about a scheme to proving that Trump was involved in orchestrating it. 


Now I get that liberals might think it’s no big leap but most States disagree which is why even the States that did charge others for the scheme like Michigan, Nevada and Arizona did not also otherwise charge Trump. Because unlike the others charged, Trump wasn’t directly involved. 


But Georgia has charged Trump. And in that case Trump’s defense is admitting that they heard about the scheme from Eastman. But they never sanctioned forgery or falsification of certificates. Anyway - that case is still pending. 


All that said - it’s difficult to say Trump is guilty of such when the whole innocent until guilty thing exists and the one case that pertains to it hasn’t resulted in a conviction yet.

post_14,post_14_18_1_1_1_1_2_2_1_1_1_1_1_2_1,"> Conservatism is a preference for the historically inherited rather than the abstract and ideal. This preference has traditionally rested on an organic conception of society—that is, on the belief that society is not merely a loose collection of individuals but a living organism comprising closely connected, interdependent members. Conservatives thus favour institutions and practices that have evolved gradually and are manifestations of continuity and stability. Government’s responsibility is to be the servant, not the master, of existing ways of life, and politicians must therefore resist the temptation to transform society and politics. This suspicion of government activism distinguishes conservatism not only from radical forms of political thought but also from liberalism, which is a modernizing, antitraditionalist movement dedicated to correcting the evils and abuses resulting from the misuse of social and political power. In The Devil’s Dictionary (1906), the American writer Ambrose Bierce cynically (but not inappropriately) defined the conservative as “a statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others.” Conservatism must also be distinguished from the reactionary outlook, which favours the restoration of a previous, and usually outmoded, political or social order.

Im answering in good faith. Youll notice none of the definitions Ive used have anything to do with economics. Thats because economics alone dont determine your political orientation. 

Its not ignoring the last 140 years. Those atrocities happened, but what makes them left wing? Segregationists also “pursued equality”, we know that wasnt a left wing movement and was purely *bullshit*. 

Left wing politics are defined by their focus on equality and egalitarianism 

Right wing politics are defined by their prioritization of hierarchy. They try to maintain and create inequality. 

Under those definitions, its very obvious that totalitarianism isnt a left wing ideology. Its a right wing ideology. 

Communism, as written by Marx and without any other political views, is a left wing ideology. 

Totalitarianism with a communist economic system is a blend of left and right and would need to be weighed as such.

That is what is so dumb about this is you almost need a totalitarian government to even enforce true equality or anything close to it because dissent cannot be tolerated. And the left has made this clear with there new stance on words you can’t say and ideas that are to dangerous to consider and must be banned. Which happens every single time.

Do you believe you should have to hold advanced degrees to be able to debate someone or that having those degrees necessarily means they’re right? As an example, one of the experts you reference, Norman Finkelstein, said the Houthis deserve a Nobel Peace Prize.

post_18,post_18_12_1_1_2_1_1,"So, you are completely provied my point for me.

One of the frustrating tactic Destiny uses, and many of the ""debate bros"" use is inconsistently holding others to be hyper-literal, while them themselves get to dismiss things as figurative. Me saying that Destiny spent a week reading Wikipedia was a figurative statement. I dont believe he literally spent a week reading Wikipedia. Obviously my statement was about his lack of actual background knowledge.

And so, sure, rhetorically....you got me. Congratulations. But as a matter of substance, you achieved absolutely nothing except forcing me to clarify a statement which didn't actually need clarification. But for a ""debate bro"" this is exactly what matters.

I never stated anything about advanced degrees. No, I don't believe that you must hold an advanced degree to debate. However, especially in the humanities you need to have a similar amount of background knowledge and at least a reasonable agreement on the facts in order to have a meaningful debate.

For example,  my degree is in history. I cant have a debate about a chronology of events with someone who doesn't acknowledge that radio carbon dating is a reliable means to provide dates to something. In stead of debating the topic we want, we would need to settle radio carbon dating first. If we don't agree on the basic facts underlying the debate, then we are having a different conversation entirely.

This is what Destiny did (and often does) in that ""debate"". Sure, it makes him seem like he has a counter argument, but it really is just obstruction, not a counter argument.

Finkelstein's views on the Houthis is absolutely irrelevant to the facts about a debate about Israel.

Did you watch the debate itself or any other ones, not clips? If we’re operating under your framework, we should be able to point out where he clearly doesn’t understand what he’s talking about. He debated one of the far-right Zionist members of Israelis government about how the expansion of West Bank settlements is preventing peace and he supports a 2 state solution. I don’t understand how someone with so little knowledge can be having these high level debates and not be easily shown he’s factually incorrect on fundamental positions. 

I have my biases, I admit, but I was open to hearing what Norman Finkelstein had to say that would lead to a better understanding of the conflict and how it may be resolved. What was his approach to talking about those issues? He pulled out individual quotes from Benny Morris’ books to attack him over (so much that the moderator had to tell him to stop) when he had that author right there that could explain the context. If he has spent his whole life to the I/P conflict, I would expect he would be able to properly educate Destiny on how he was factually incorrect. Instead, he spent the whole debate slinging insults and calling him different names.

>Finkelstein's views on the Houthis is absolutely irrelevant to the facts about a debate about Israel.

It’s relevant when he appeals to international law. Is there not a glaring contradiction when you claim Israel is breaking international law and we should respect the rules/laws in place yet his position is that it the Houthis breaking international law is acceptable?

Im asking for the arguments. Concrete examples you can point to and say “This is his argument and this is why it’s wrong.” I would understand then where you’re coming from. Saying someone just uses rhetoric to win but their arguments are fake or faulty shows but people aren’t willing to provide those examples is lazy at best and dishonest at worst.

Did he not talk about the specific intent required and necessary as a component of genocide, dolus specialis? Is that international law and intent merely a rhetorical argument and not a factual component of genocide? 

> Similarly, I only care about the factual basis of the October 7th attack. I am not interested in Hamas' justification. I can think for my self.

A group kills the most amount of Jews since the Holocaust, records themselves doing it, shares it with the world, claims they do it and why, and you aren’t interested in their justification? That’s wild.

post_18,post_18_21,"Looking at your flair, you may enjoy [Breaking Points](https://www.youtube.com/@breakingpoints). It's my go-to for non-MSM analysis. The comment section and reddit sub trend significantly right but the hosts themselves span the political spectrum. They all agree on hating MSM though.

For more strictly liberal and less serious analysis I would suggest [Secular Talk](https://www.youtube.com/@SecularTalk). I say less serious because he's more casual, but he covers everything from serious topics to nonsense that's just fun.

[The Majority Report](https://www.youtube.com/@TheMajorityReport) is also a really good one for liberal analysis. Unlike Breaking Points their opinions are strictly liberal, but they're also more professional than Kyle over at Secular Talk.

I have others that I follow but I only really watch them when the link is interesting. I usually catch everything the above puts out on youtube though. Also, note that I don't pay for any subscriptions or premium content

I should also highlight Morning Joe over on MSNBC. I know he's a conservative and it's a mainstream morning show, but it is THE source for knowing where the Biden administration is at politically. Similar to how Trump watched Fox and Friends daily, Biden watches Morning Joe and according to reporting, speaks with the hosts on the phone fairly regularly. They're not nearly as honest about the facts as the people on youtube, but you know when you're watching that this is where the Biden team's head is at.

In many ways, the current situation resembles the 1970s except the unemployment is not as high. The economy put up pathetic numbers last years and inflation remained relatively high. Which is probably a mild version of stagflation.

The situation in _2021 and 2022_ matched this, as both stagflation in the 1970s and this were initiated by supply shocks. When the aggregate supply shifts leftwards, the entire economic output decreases (recessionary) _and_ prices go up. 

The situation _now_ is just the typical unemployment-inflation trade off that we get when the economy is running hot.

> So you can say the number is arbitrary but it’s not, it’s circumstance dependent 

That is once again my point. One central banker in New Zealand in an offhand comment said that there’s some ideal inflation target “like 2%” that got publicized and central banks made it an unofficial, then official policy to always target 2% inflation. 

That specific target, 2% is arbitrary. 

It would be better policy to have targets based on circumstance. If getting to 3 means getting to a situation where wages can grow faster than inflation, but getting down to 2 means a recession, unemployment and a poorer populace, then dont make 2 your goal. 

In the opposite situation if getting to 1.5 means you can raise incomes and increase workforce participation, but getting to 2 means you have to bankrupt the country with huge stimulus even though unemployment is already low, then there’s no point in that extra cost to get to 2.

post_19,post_19_3,"Looking at the full Reuters article, I’m a bit confused on what’s being rebutted. But, full disclosure, I’ve not taken any economics since grad school.

> Corporate price gouging has not been a primary driver of U.S. inflation, according to research published on Monday by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

Article thesis statement. Doesn’t seem to be saying that greedflation isn’t a thing, but that it’s not the *primary* driver of inflation for the country.

> While markups for motor vehicles and petroleum products did rise sharply during the 2021-2022 inflation surge, markups across the entire spectrum of U.S. goods and services have been relatively flat during the post-pandemic recovery, the bank's latest Economic Letter showed.

Was the argument that corporations were *continually* raising prices at an exorbitant rate, or that they raised prices a lot to deal with sudden COVID expenses *and then did not lower the prices once those expenses were no longer on the balance sheet.*

That’s a very different accusation. Prices are going to keep going up with inflation, but if there’s still that COVID bump in the base price, but no longer the COVID expense in production, people call foul.

> “As such, rising markups have not been a main driver of the recent surge and subsequent decline in inflation during the current recovery,"" wrote the bank's research chief Sylvain Leduc and colleagues Huiyu Li and Zheng Liu.

This also seems to be addressing the idea that corporations are continually and over time adding price bumps out of pure greed, versus the idea that they’re just keeping the COVID bump in the price, even though they no longer have the same COVID expenses.

> U.S. President Joe Biden has blamed corporate greed for still-elevated prices, accusing companies of boosting profits by shrinking portion sizes but leaving the selling price unchanged, and by failing to pass on falling costs to consumers.

*That.* That’s what I’ve understood “greedflation” to be—the still-elevated prices that take into account COVID expenses like constant sanitation and installing sanitizer machines and paying for more sick leave and for emergency hires. Those aren’t on the balance sheet anymore, but the cost is still passed to the consumer.

> Fed policymakers, and many economists, say the inflation surge can be better explained by the combined effect of supply chain disruptions and a drop in labor supply during the post-pandemic recovery that occurred just as consumer demand rose.

Exactly. And that disruption has passed, as has the worst of the pandemic. But prices are still set as though corporations were hemorrhaging cash to deal with COVID. 

> Leduc and his colleagues did not refer to Biden or use the colloquial term 'greedflation,' but their work was a clear rebuttal of the theory that corporate profiteering has been a main cause of higher prices. 

Not a main cause is still not the same thing as “not a thing.”

> “Data for the current recovery show that the increase in corporate profits is not particularly pronounced compared with previous recoveries,"" the San Francisco Fed researchers wrote. ""Markups also have not played much of a role in the slowing of inflation since the summer of 2022.""

And just because we *usually* see a greedflation factor during recoveries (the rich always get richer in emergencies) doesn’t mean it’s not a thing to be concerned about.

post_19,post_19_4_1_1,"If the cost of the raw ingredient has gone down, while the price of the end product has both shrunk and gone up - something along the line is price gouging.

It might not be the retailer directly, it might not be Frito Lay themselves, but someone somewhere is doing it.

To put it another way - if I, say, manufacture and provide filters for vacuum cleaners that Dyson buys from me for use in their V-series, and the cost of my parts goes up 20% in 2020, I then put up my costs 20% and push the increase down the line to Dyson who inevitably push the cost of their vacuum by an equivalent amount to make up for it.

If the cost of my parts drop back to where they were in, say, 2019 - I can either drop my price back to where it was, or I can keep it at the high rate. My orders from Dyson didn’t change due to the increase in price, so why *wouldn’t* I keep the price as it was? It’s all extra profit for me.

If no-one else does this, the vacuum cleaner will still be 20% more expensive than it was because of my profit gouging. Best Buy might not make an extra 20% on the sale, but I am. If every provider in the chain does this, you end up with a product that is 30% more expensive despite being smaller, despite the retailer themselves not changing their markup percentage (though ultimately making more money because the markup is a percentage not a flat fee). 

It’s also self-fulfilling. Thinks inflate in cost, so I put my prices up. But when my parts come down in cost, the fact that all the things I buy for my everyday needs have inflated in cost means I’m even less incentivised to drop my prices. 

Then people stop buying Dyson vacuums because their price has inflated so much. So my filter orders slow. I’m left with the choice of dropping my prices to try and get more orders, expanding my business to other vacuum companies, or increasing my prices further to make up for the shortfall in revenue and profit.

Let’s say I have shareholders in my vacuum filter business… I have a fiduciary duty to make them more money. So I either drop prices a little and hope to sell more, or I increase the price further and hope the increased price makes up for a smaller sales volume.

Yes that's what I meant by 'It becomes an exercise of ""We have a big enough sample size of dating to extrapolate patterns/trends from""'

It's still not a hard science because of the human factor, even if you can make reasonably accurate predictions over a large sample size. Human behavior is unpredictable on the micro level, but is somewhat predictable on the macro level. 

That's what makes economics ""soft"". There's ""laws"" in economics but they're not *really laws* because of the it still just being an interpretation of human behavior. If you hit a ball with a hammer, it's going to act the same way given the conditions every single time. The same input will basically always give the same output. That's not true of the soft sciences.

First, ""price gouging"" has a specific meaning, and that's not what he saw over the last two to three years.  Second, companies increase prices during inflationary periods because they expect that the prices of the inputs to their goods and services will continue to be hit by inflation in the coming months, so they take the extra profit as a buffer.

To be clear, this nine percent number is from select companies--the 100 most highly-paid CEOs that *also* files data with the SEC--not exactly the most robust cross-section.  On top of that, the 9 percent increase does not refer to pay, but rather remuneration.

Sure--there's no dearth of information:  while [this write-up](https://www.dallasfed.org/cd/communities/2022/0808) uses nominal wages, they do note that real wages have increased recently, with the biggest gains in wage growth going to the lowest-paid workers.  Even as more current data shows the job market cooling and real wages rising at a more modest rate (but still [rising](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker#)), labor is in a much better position than it was two years ago.  

The rising wages is why we had such a tight labor market and for so long--even as it's loosening, it's still below four percent.  Not every company is going to be content with the status quo--they want the best employees, and will shell out money; they poach from other companies.

No, they do not suggest that a ""good portion"" is from people leaving work--they merely point out that workforce quits at the lowest level could skew the data.

They also note that various other factors, such as retirements in the highest quintile could also skew the data.  Retirements, quits, etc. *always* can have an affect on the data.

However, as I mentioned, this was an earlier analysis (I thought write-up was pretty good though).

Couple that with significant pent-up demand following the lockdowns, and we now have demand that is higher than pre-pandemic levels, coupled with less supply than before (a perfect storm for high inflation), along with some labor market disruptions. A lot of people (not everybody, but many) had more money to spend than before (from raises, unemployment/government-assistance programs, shifts in labor demand and sharp increases in tech hiring, increased liquidity from the feds being pumped into various parts of the economy, etc), and that meant that there was less market resistance to price increases than there was before.

It was a perfect storm. More demand coupled with less supply created macroeconomic conditions that were ripe for inducing lamentably sharp price increases.

post_19,post_19_11_2,">What do you believe is causing the current persistent inflation?

Possible explanations:

* **Increases in the cost of labor in China:** We all got addicted to cheap manufactured goods from China, but the cost of labor there has been increasing at a rapid clip. It is almost *inevitable* that we would face higher prices as a result.
* **Inflation Expectations:** Bizarrely, one thing that causes inflation is the [expectation](https://old.reddit.com/user/othelloinc/) of inflation.
* **Demographic Changes (labor):** As the Baby Boomers enter retirement, the workforce is losing our biggest generation ever; we should expect a drop in productivity as a result.
* **Demographic Changes (capital):** Also, those of them with retirement savings are probably moving into risk-averse investments. That could lead to decreased investment where it is needed most. Imagine a businessman saying 'the price of X is so high, right now; I should invest in producing more X' but struggling to find the money to make that investment.
* **Housing is the everything problem:** More people and jobs are in denser urban areas, and near-zero of them have built enough housing to meet demand. Until the housing supply increases, that problem will persist.
* **Service sector wages are increasing:** The low unemployment rate is leading service-sector employers to raise wages in an attempt to outbid each other. (This is arguably a good thing, but it will almost certainly raise prices to some extent.)
* **Strong job growth:** Low unemployment means everyone has money in their pockets. The more money we have, the more likely we are to still buy something, even after the price went up!",0.032545314124726,0.0085360407829284,0.4997677206993103,0.0009365379810333,0,0

post_20,post_20_1_1_2,"**TL;DR: The airline hiring process is brutal and nobody is getting hired without the proper qualifications**

> A pilot does not need college.

You're correct that pilots don't need a degree - just the flight training pipeline - but a college degree was a requirement for a long time to get hired at a top airline job (DL/AA/UA/FX/UPS). There were hiring frenzies in 2018-2019 and a huge one 2021-2023 in which that requirement was dropped by those airlines to account for a bit of a pilot shortage. 

The way airline hiring works, at least at the big airlines, is a points system. Different things on the application are given points values. This includes college, but other things like volunteer work, driving history, general work history, but ESPECIALLY flight hours, flying qualifications, etc. There's a minimum threshold the application has to hit to get a call for an interview. Many places have an aptitude or reasoning test that has to be taken before that point, but after the app gets a response, and if it doesn't hit that, you don't get a call back. Personality tests are also common, though where exactly you take it differs - before the interview, during, etc. One place famously has candidates talk to a psychiatrist, although that occurs at the actual interview.

Once at the actual interview, the interview generally will include HR and one or two pilots. Sometimes there's an HR interview in advance.  The panel will take notes and make recommendations, and then the final decision will generally be made by a ""blind"" pilot hiring board.

It's an extremely grueling process. Just getting a call back on your application alone requires A LOT of effort and qualifications. Getting through the actual interview is even tougher, and generally requires spending hundreds of dollars on interview prep, because the airlines can tell who did and didn't do interview prep and if you didn't, they'll consider you as not having tried hard enough. It's a giant fucking gauntlet.

A couple extra points on the application - for example, a DEI initiative thing - only gets you to the interview. It doesn't get you the job. I promise you that nobody is getting hired at AA solely due to their skin color or gender. Anyone who makes it as far as that interview has the qualifications to do the job. And that's *before* you consider how few pilots are minorities, and how few are women. AA, or anyone else, could NEVER staff the airline if they only hired according to a DEI initiative. It's one of the most lily white, and male, industries there is.

To be completely frank, whoever fed you that about AA has No. Fucking. Idea. what they are talking about.

Most of the time you weed out the ones that are a no then look at the rest who may sit around the same level of acceptability. Some of those are going to rise above because they can sell themselves well. Then you think about the person - well, she got my obscure reference, or he went to school with my brother, or I liked the way they smelled. Something stupid like that tips the scale so often. How often do I just feel a kinship with this white woman over here because she has a similar life experience to me rather than the black woman who just moved here? She feels like she would be a better fit because I'm a good fit and this woman is like me, cool.  It's not like people are really even aware of this most of the time, but those things do play a part and taking time to think about it makes you aware of how superficial and paper thin some of the hiring decisions can be.

The biggest lie is that there is *one objectively better* candidate for most jobs. Nah, there's sooooo much subjectivity in hiring. I once had a manager tell me the tipping point for hiring me over another was that she liked my signature. No, she didn't do handwriting analysis or anything, she just thought it looked cool.",0.1125809753912184,0.0405505299568176,0.4996677935123443,0.0033252537250518,0,1

I personally don't think this goes far enough. I think for positions of power and representation, the makeup of the body should maximize representation of every identity group in the US that we possibly can. This means appointments should *intentionally* select people based on their identity group memberships.

This is one of the reasons I'm a fan of proportional representation used in other forms of government, rather than our system, which magnifies majorities, and incentivizes gerrymandering.

>It's ok when we do it"" should really be the leftist motto.

I just don't think you understand what people are saying. It is possible to believe both of these things at the same time: 

1. Employment should be based on qualifications and people shouldn't have the opportunity to be racist or sexist against candidates so as to perpetuate societal inequality and injustice.
2. Appointments to positions of power should be made with consideration of representation of the American people. 

Since we probably agree on (1), we can enshrine that in law and criminalize violations of it when they happen. That's basically what this whole post is about. Discriminating on race in hiring is illegal even though many conservatives have been misled into thinking it's rampant.

But since (2) isn't that, we're not going to agree on the best principles to use in appointing people to positions and power within our government, and since the authority for how appointments work is in the Constitution, and the Constitution does not prescribe a certain way that we need to qualify or select people for the role, the best we can do is be mad when it doesn't look the way we want it to look and do the things the Constitution says we can do to fix it. Trump can make a point to say ""I am going to make it a point to nominate a *white* candidate"" and it would be exactly the same conversation. I'm sure liberals would be upset at that, and might question his motives for doing so, but ultimately the Constitution grants him that ability, right?

Some voters vote on the basis of race. If these votes become deciding votes, did the American people engage in illegal employment discrimination? How do we remedy that?

Like can you give me any plausible way you imagine we could enforce employment law against a Supreme Court Justice nomination? Would a candidate that wasn't chosen file an EEOC complaint? What would an EEOC response look like? If you imagine this is criminal discrimination, who would be charged with the crime? The President? The Senate?

Take a moment to actually read through the links you just provided, and try and identify a *single* instance of one of these employers making an employment decision on the basis of membership in a protected class.

Diversity goals in employment are satisfied through recruiting, sourcing, diversifying professional networks, eliminating sources of racial bias in the hiring pipeline, your system of recognizing merit and promotions, and by making your place of employment attractive for people of all identity groups, so that they encourage their own friends to apply.

Source: I have run large organizations and have built hiring pipelines from scratch with diversity goals, spending many hours in meetings with HR and employment lawyers navigating these lines.

The popular conservative understanding of diversity/DEI is a fantasy.

Yes. Companies meet diversity goals using the methods I discussed already. These methods do not involve discriminating on race in hiring decisions. Sending your recruiters to women-in-tech conferences is how it's done. Telling your hiring team to pick the less-qualified woman over a more-qualified man in order to meet gender quotas is a form of illegal employment discrimination.

They do, not quite by definition, but certainly by practical application.

No. If you decide to hire a black (white) candidate over a white (black) candidate for reasons of race (racial quotas, diversity targets, whatever the reason), where race isn't a core requirement of the job itself, this is illegal employment discrimination.

If this is happening today, it needs to be reported to the EEOC so that remedy can occur and the illegal behavior will stop.

In reality, this isn't actually happening. Conservatives see things like ""diversity goals"" and go straight to ""the only way I imagine that could be done is racial discrimination"", so that becomes the conservative narrative despite no evidence that that's actually happening.

So yes, discriminating against someone in employment decisions on the basis of race is wrong and (already) illegal.

I know we've already had this conversation and apparently you didn't internalize anything I said before, but I'll try one more time: 

Your understanding of what's happening here is incorrect. I have run large organizations and have built hiring pipelines inside the US government. Using race as a criteria in hiring is explicitly illegal, even inside the US government.

Diversity goals are achieved through targeted sourcing, recruiting, and not making your office the kind of workplace people of color want to leave, such as by fairly promoting people, giving everyone professional development opportunities, and eliminating for mitigating any kind of bias you might discover.

Since you brought up the US government in particular, I think you'd benefit from reading it from the horse's mouth: 

https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/

Nowhere in that order is there any hint of preferential hiring based on protected characteristics, as you are claiming is happening.

Incorrect. Full stop. You should talk to your HR team or your company's employment lawyers before you continue to make false statements about your employer's hiring practices. 

Racial quotas of any kind are illegal. You cannot use race as a factor in hiring decisions for any reason whatsoever\*. Not for racism, not for diversity, not for achieving representation in your workforce. The hiring process must evaluate all candidates that apply for a position without regard to their race, gender, or membership in any other protected class.

Any EEOC-mandated affirmative action plans are about correcting past instances of illegal employment discrimination, but even these plans cannot simply result in the employer discriminating ""back"". Racial quotas are illegal, even in affirmative action plans, even if those are mandatory.

>If we have two candidates, one diverse and less qualified, and one non-diverse but more qualified, we are to consider hiring the former, to increase the diversity of the firm.

This is illegal employment discrimination and you should report this to the EEOC. I look forward, again, to a progress report.

**READ YOUR OWN FUCKING SOURCE**. Top to bottom. It's short. Don't skim. Don't search for keywords. Just read it and internalize it. Don't miss the green box at the bottom.

Nothing in this document recommends or legitimizes *any* kind of post-evaluation racial discrimination. Two key bullets for you to read, re-read, figure out how to reconcile with your erroneous worldview, and then read again (emphasis mine):

>* The program establishes numerical goals or targets (such as “aim to double the percentage of women we hire to direct television shows with our studio this season” or “we will hire crews that better reflect the demographics of California’s skilled labor pool”) but not rigid quotas or set-asides (such as **“the next 5 people we hire in X job must be women” or “we need 10 Black people in Y job”**).
*The program does not unduly harm members of non-targeted groups, **such as by refusing to hire any people from those groups, or firing such individuals in order to reach the numerical target.**

What *you're* describing is racial quotas. Racial quotas are illegal employment discrimination, whether done for diversity or correcting past racism. You cannot refuse to hire someone based on their race and you cannot set aside positions. Your source clearly says this.

What you can do is have abstract goals, and you meet these goals through things that are **not** selecting black candidates over white candidates. You do targeted recruiting, you clean up your GlassDoor complaints, you de-bias your promotion and retention processes, you fire the racist hiring manager that got you into that mess to begin with. You achieve diversity in hiring by achieving a diverse pool of candidates.

Education and experience are obviously good metrics to evaluate judges. But it's not clear to me that they alone point to the very objective and clear ""best"" candidate.

post_20,post_20_20,">Do you support a company hiring based apon skin color, gender, or sexual preferences OK?

No. And in the US at least, this is illegal employment discrimination. If you believe this is happening at your company, you can report it to.the EEOC, or have another employee report it on your behalf.

When companies seek diversity (or even just proportional representation), what they actually do is:

1. Target their recruiting to underrepresented groups. 
2. Show up at conferences and events that specifically highlight underrepresented groups 
3. Intentionally have people expand their LinkedIn networks (most people's professional networks look like them).
4. Scrutinize their hiring process to eliminate any form of bias that might have unintentionally crept in. This might involve things like blinding resumes so that resume reviewers don't have anything to exhibit unconscious bias against. 
5. Make the workplace the kind of place their employees of color recommend to their professional networks.

Doing these kinds of things results in a higher fraction of applicants being people of color, women, etc. If the rest of your hiring process is unbiased, this means you will end up with a diverse (or representative) workforce.

>does this leave more qualified applicants left out?

It shouldn't, no. Nothing about the process I'm describing above includes any kind of racial quotas for preference given in the actual hiring process itself. Diversity is achieved in hiring by achieving it in applications. The evaluation itself should be unbiased. 

Source: I have run large organizations and have built hiring pipelines from scratch with diversity as a goal. I have spent more hours in rooms with HR and employment lawyers figuring these things out than I think anyone here has spent in threads answering variations of this question.

>Is it fair if let's say, a black lesbian with 2 years in college was to get a job over a cis white man with 4 years? Didn't he in the end put in more work, and therefore deserve the job more?

If you're hiring for a line cook position and want to pay $20/hr, and a highly qualified professional chef asking $100/hr applies, it's rational to choose the less qualified candidate. Same if the more qualified candidate is likely to be there only briefly while you want someone more long term, etc.

If someone wants to do that, I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with it as long as the job doesn't require a college degree to begin with. If the job needs someone with a college degree, then the first person shouldn't be hired.

> Didn't he in the end put in more work

A college degree is about education level, not how much work someone has put in. Someone could be only doing 5 hours of actual stuff a day while in college, whereas another person could be working two jobs, 10 to 12 hours a day. Or it could be the other way around, but either way, a college degree does not necessarily signify the amount of work you put in.",0.03552321796987,0.0779955983161926,0.4997482299804687,0.0001395046710968,0,1

In the example that you provided, the only disparity between the two people was a couple years of college. Whether those two years matters to an employer depends on the job.   

DEI policies at companies simply are not about hiring people based on race/gender/sexual preference regardless of their experience. They are about promoting an inclusive and diverse workplace. 

My company does this well. For hiring practices, managers are not encouraged to hire certain people over others. Rather they are encouraged to reach out to those communities and broaden the pool of applicants. We also have groups that meet to discuss issues related to race/gender/sexuality/disability. Anyone is free to join any of those groups, and they are a great way to network and to learn about the needs and experiences of that group. 

It helps to improve the work environment and make all people feel more included. My industry was historically white cis male dominated, so that is actually an important thing. If people who are not part of the main group at your company, they may not even apply there for fear of being isolated. Having a DEI policy encourages people from more communities to want to work there, and increases your potential pool of candidates. 

In the end, it is literally a good business decision to have these policies.  It is hard to find good people to staff a company, and working with a larger pool of applicants really helps. And managers will absolutely not use those policies to hire a black lesbian over a white cis male if the black lesbian is significantly less qualified.

The fact is that more people get hired for stable well-paying jobs through networking and connections more than they do by cold resume submissions on places like LinkedIn. And when, for most of history, the people in a position to hire through those connections are white people, that means white people have an unfair advantage in being hired for well-paying jobs, and something needs to be done to correct for the racial biases. A white person in upper management is more likely to network and connect with other people who have lived in his/her circles, grown up in the same neighborhood as them, went to the same school as them, and for most white people in America, those are other white people.

You are referring to a BFOQ - i.e., someone of a different race literally cannot perform the job. Jobs like that are very rare and there is reason why you had to go to entertainment to find it, rather than something like, I don't know, the entire financial or tech sectors?

I have many friends of different races, and they have never had any issues getting a job based on race. Many of them are extremely well-off too. This issue is a made-up point for a liberal Democrat's voting campaign. liberals constantly call the Republicans racist because we don't see other races as above us.

Stating this does not automatically mean we look down on them. we look them in the eyes as fellow human beings, not gods. We don't sacrifice for them because they are capable human beings. They are equals. There ARE cases of racist Republicans, but that does not make all republicans racists. If you believe that, you believe a stereotype, something you are so adamant against. I call it hypocrisy.

Same as politicians, both sides included, saying to do one thing and doing the complete opposite. This leads back to the discrimination. If it keeps being pushed, racism will loop around, as more and more advantages are given to minorities, and suddenly it is the whites who are being discriminated against.

This is my issue. I want my children to be equal to their fellow Americans, whether Black, Latino, Asian, Native, or Indian. This is not about myself, I can deal with my own crap.

The reasonable thing to do when someone unintentionally brings something illegal into a country and is obviously attempting to follow the law is confiscate the illegal item and perhaps issue a fine.

12 years in prison for someone with zero criminal intent who at best we could say didn't do a good enough job looking through her bag to clean it out is absolutely monstrous.  No reasonable human being could support that prosecution.  It is ridiculous that the state department has to even get involved.  If the prosecutor was a decent human being and not a monster devoid of morality they would have just refused to file charges.  That's a miscarriage of justice on the level of what happens in countries like Iran, not what you'd expect from a country like the UK.

Shit, we don't even know for sure that the ammo was theirs.  For all we know, they bought a used duffel bag someone previously used to go to the firearm range and they just didn't see a round or two of ammunition in it.

post_21,post_21_3_4_1_1_1_1_1_1_1,"I think calling this political persecution is a stretch unless there’s evidence that this law is being only applied to some travelers but not others.

My core point is that while unfair punishments should be prevented, travelers also have an obligation to ensure that they are complying with the law to avoid ending up in a position where they could be punished like this. Every US passport reminds travelers that they will be bound by the laws of the country they are in, and that punishments can be significantly more severe. You and I can go round and round on whether or not it’s fair to need to be that careful, but whether it’s fair or not is kinda beside the point, because it’s what is, and there’s not a ton that can be done about that. If a country wants to make something illegal on a strict liability basis and has harsh punishments for it, that’s a signal that you need to be on your toes when you go there, and if that’s going to be a problem, maybe travel elsewhere. It’s not fair, but that’s life. Brittney griner should have been more careful to not bring marijuana derived products to Russia. These 5 people should have been more careful to not bring ammunition to Turks and Caicos. Griner’s punishment, and these 5 people’s potential punishments, are/would be unjust, and the government was correct to work to free griner and would be correct to try to intervene on these people’s behalf, but they all undertook actions that made it possible for the punishment to apply at all.

post_22,post_22_0,"The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.

In today’s installment of stuff I hear from women on dates but can’t conceptualize: a “classless society”.  

Socioeconomic class is born out of several factors in my opinion. Your starting point in life, how you were raised, your innate skills, internal drive, etc.  

So many factors go into it, but how can you equalize even most things? It’s easy to say “oh everyone can start from the same place”, but  can they? The social and professional connections your parents make as well as how they raise you definitely play a factor in your life circumstances.  

Let’s say there’s a guy who bakes the most amazing cakes. It isn’t a secret recipe either so the office of resource management can’t beat it out of him and make it public knowledge. He uses his skills to curry favor with people who provide other luxuries. His kids through exposure and their own innate abilities also learn these talents, but he doesn’t bother to teach anyone else. He spends time with other people with talents like his and they enrich each other’s lives but *not* the general public.  

Isn’t that the same class-based system we have now, substituting money with talent?  

Bonus Question: straight ladies do you expect a dude to pay on the first date? I generally just ask to split but this date was the first time someone said they thought I would have covered it.

post_22,post_22_1,"You're trying to map the idea of a classless society onto a society that looks basically like ours but is somehow economically tweaked.

The Marxist idea of a classless society is something that exists under fundamentally different circumstances than we have; it's part of a communist utopia where economics and politics operate on completely different principles.

Here's my ultra streamlined summary on Marxist theory:

* People take inherent joy in production.  You probably know people who grow vegetables in the garden or knit sweaters or build things or bake cakes as a hobby.  I have an aunt who is retired and does nothing but crochet; she is desperate to find things to crochet for people, find people who will take sweaters, etc. so her house doesn't overflow
* Capitalist industrial society alienates people from that joy of production by turning everything ugly and transactional.  Work is needlessly unpleasant under capitalism.
* But what if (in part because technology helps to solve issues of scarcity) we could reclaim that joy of production?
* Then we enter into a utopia where each person produces according to their ability (and desire) and consumes according to their need.  The people who take joy in baking bake to their heart's content, and then people who need something to eat take the baked goods and eat them.
* This is a classless society because with everyone taking delight in production, there's plenty to go around, and everyone has enough of everything quasi-effortlessly.  You don't need to curry favor with anyone because there's abundance.

Does that work out? Not really.  There's no reason to suppose that joyful production will match the things we need, and there are jobs in society that need to be done that will probably never provide joy.  But Marx was certainly putting his finger on some things that are real; in a utopia, my aunt would crochet sweaters for all who wanted them.",0.0435703466474095,0.00855153799057,0.499729722738266,0.1617464125156402,0,1
post_22,post_22_1_1,"You put forward great ""good feeling"" answer where all people find joy in their own livelihood but I dare to say there's a more down-to-earth practical explanation that's often only implied:

That there's not a group of people standing out above others, mostly materially.

When we usually talk about classes we refer to different material environments groups of people live in. It depends on economic contexts but like, an upper class is often understood as a group of people who can comfortably afford a pretty luxurious life and so on.

Based on this, there's the assumption that class differences cause power inequalities that are for one reason or another considered to be unjust. For example, people born into poor families have lower chances of becoming successful in their job industry.

So the promise of classless society seems to be the image of society mostly without material differences.",0.0298469607716258,0.0100616216659545,0.4997726380825043,0.0132952332496643,0,1
post_22,post_22_1_2,"Going beyond that though, your examples of ""joyful production"" were more like hobbies.

But you don't need tasks to be fun in that way to not be alienating.

Take a household, a family, a group of roomates, a village. People do tasks that are even individually pretty unpleasant because they need to get done. Because what we can value is helping people around us, because we have a sense of valuing things running smoothly and having a nice shared space.

Liberalism expanded into ideas like race/ethnicity shouldn't hold people back, that the government should work to make accomodations to advance human potential like the ""ADA, Civil Rights, Healthcare, Welfare."" While maintaining a market based competitive society ultimately based on merit.

A ""classless society"" is a pipe dream that will never happen, at least not any time soon. Most people know this liberal or conservative. We can see the monumental failures in mid century communism to achieve this. We can look at every human civilization that has ever existed and conclude that realistically people will categorize themselves and others into groups. Liberalism isn't terribly concerned with making everyone equal in outcomes. In fact liberals believe in the ""profit motive"" as a positive thing. Modern liberalism however does want to give everyone a chance at competing for profit and being rewarded. 

Liberals will often look at disparities between groups and look to government policies to bridge those gaps. This is not done with the purpose of eliminating rich people or even poor people(as these concepts are relative) but to identify ways in which people are disadvantaged and then try to bridge that gap so that everyone is starting from the same point. This doesn't mean that in the end everyone will be equal.

Liberal and conservative are broad categories, especially in the US. You identify as a liberal so I don't expect you to market positively for conservatives. But I think this characterization really gets to the heart of the issue. Conservative could mean any number of ideologies. I'm not going to deny that there is a branch of conservativism that is simply reactionary. But there are other branches that genuinely believe their policies will lead to a more equitable and prosperous society. Not every conservative is a knee jerk reactionary. 

>the history of liberalism is basically a fight between conservatives that at every turn conservatives freak out and think that society is going to crumble if some tradition or old hierarchy is disbanded and resisting liberal attempts to upend it. 

This is the righteous narrative that liberals generally present, but it's not true at all. History is rife with policies that liberals advocated for that were opposed by conservatives. Some, like restrictive zoning, or prohibition, or sterilization of mentally handicapped people became law and proved to be monumentally destructive. Others, like free silver, never became policy. 

The common response is a disingenuous form of the no true scotsman fallacy, which would be to claim that 'the majority of liberals in 2024 don't support those policies, therefore they weren't liberal policies'. However, by that standard, your above statement would be incorrect, as conservatives today support an established liberal policy, therefore the opponents years ago weren't true conservatives. 

>Conservatives are often accused of believing that there is no point to this because groups of people have different innate traits, either generic or cultural that give them advantages or disadvantages and that this is not up to government policy to change.

The key word is accused. And the other key word is groups. Yes, conservatives are often accused of that by liberals. But that's usually because it's easier to call them a racism than to debate in good faith. While some people identify as conservative and also believe certain 'groups' have certain innate traits, it's a minority. The majority of conservatives believe *each individual* has different traits.

post_22,post_22_2_3_1_1_1,"Something that should be noted is that Republicans and Democrats do not equal Liberal or Conservative. Some Republicans especially in the past were more liberal than conservative. The past had many Democrats that were more  conservative than liberal. 

Some policies, let's take the idea of prohibition would be considered a conservative progressive policy. Undeniably the thought of restricting personal use of alcohol is illiberal, however it's also progressive because the aim was to use government policy to improve the country through government intervention.  

Even a liberal like myself has conservative views in some areas. Plenty of people on the left are not exactly liberals, some openly oppose liberalism as an ideology. 

Liberalism has utterly failed to achieve its own goals plenty of times. However forced sterilization, restrictive zoning and prohibition are not liberal policies. Did liberals support them at times yes. Particularly Eugenics, many otherwise liberal people supported Eugenic policies. The question I have with that is...how is Eugenics liberal aside from liberal intellectuals supporting it? Sometimes it gets complicated. For instance being pro-choice, that is liberal under the fact that it falls under personal choice and individual freedom. However forced sterilization of poor or infirmed people for the good of society is the opposite of liberal. Did liberals and people on the left support this illiberal policy for a time...yes. 

Zoning laws are illiberal. Generally speaking the entire zoning process is trapped into less partisan, even more special interest influenced local politics sphere. 

What is liberal which also causes problems regarding housing is community hearings. One way that I break with liberalism and would welcome a more centralized system is this overly beurocratic and obviously liberal policy of community input for local building projects contributed to housing shortages and infrastructure building. 

""Free Silver"" is also not at all liberal. It was a populist left-wing nonsense policy that is irrelevant. 

Liberal is more often than not left-wing but not necessarily. Conservatives sometimes support liberal ideas. There is a liberal consensus on many issues meaning many conservatives do hold liberal views. 

I think a better way of honestly looking at conservatives is to say they want to protect the status quo and promote a unified culture that is heavily reliant on traditional values. Not every conservative is even into this collectivist type thinking. 

My point is that modern partisan US politics and politics in most liberal democracies are by definition done in liberal spaces. Many conservatives hold liberal views. Liberalism is in many ways a consensus. So...you are going to find a lot of liberalism within conservative ideologies. Less conservativism in liberal ideologies. However there are right wing and left wing illiberal ideologies.

Most liberals hold a Marxist view on class. I do as well. From that perspective, there are really only three classes; capitalists, bourgeoisie and proletariat. Your example isn't really an example of class, it's just someone with an important skill. In this case, a doctor.

Which is why I added my edit. To many on the left, a classless society genuinely means some form of 'from each according to their ability, to each according to their need'. To many on the right however, a classless society doesn't have a pithy phrase to encapsulate it, but means essentially 'without government imposed structures that allow rent seeking wealth accumulation, we can reach a point in which all people will live prosperous and productive lives. And, importantly, extreme disparity in wealth would cease to exist, because, at its core, that disparity is caused by government structures'. 

So, yes, a doctor would be compensated more than a street sweeper. But the disparity between both the street sweeper and doctor, and importantly, the disparity between those two and the uber wealthy capitalist, would be much smaller and much more equitable. 

Do you disagree? Most people I know on the right, at least those who pay attention to things, hold the position that, while free markets are positive, as is generating wealth, the massive amount of wealth held by guys like Bezos, Musk et al, is a direct result of government policies, namely central bank led expansionary monetary policy, copyright and trademark law, and regulatory capture.",0.044961147659997,0.0171412825584411,0.4997527599334717,0.0136942863464355,0,0

This is where you run counter to (what I believe is) the comment. They (again assumption) are probably not talking about socioeconomic class. They are probably talking about a Marxist definition of class which is **much** less wholistic. It is purely about a person making money from _owning_ business(es) verses a person making money for _working at_ businesses. A classless society (in a Marxist pov) would be a society that has collapsed this distinction so all workers are owners and all owners are workers.

19th Century Europe, on the other hand, was just starting to get over a society/economy that was fully dominated by landed aristocratic that derived their wealth from agricultural holdings and who passed their wealth and titles of nobility onto their heirs. The only people who lear ed to read were either this ruling class, merchants, or clergy.

There was no ""get good grades, become a lawyer, make partner, and retire with a $6m net worth.""

post_22,post_22_13,"A classes society is a Marxist concept. Don’t make the mistake of coming from a social-economic class perspective. That is a different framework which will not work here. 

Classless is about not having Marxist class distinctions between capital ownership and proletariat (those who must sell their labor to live). It’s definitionally a property distinction. It means a society without private property. Everyone would have the same relationship to society in how they must secure their means of subsistence and social reproduction. 

If you own enough property. Your life’s needs (bought on the market) is secured through income based on rents and or property sales. If you rent property, you must sell your labor to an employer to get enough income to rent that property and other means of living your life. These are the two classes. 


To answer your question. Several communities have had classless societies throughout history. Famously many North American tribes had semi nomadic and settled agricultural societies without property. Meaning they were classless. The distribution of resources and property was a matter of social arrangements inside and between families as well as convention be politics at the clan and at the tribe level. Social position (NOT class) was generally inherited. This is pretty normal in all societies. 

As you can see… There lots of different answers to your question of what a classless society might be like. The only examples of modern industrialised class society we have are the Comintern countries. Now these didn’t have class distinctions (though arguably in different settings party membership construed a social class separation; but that risks making this discussion too long). Of course they still had inequality and hierarchy, if much less than say the US has now. It still saw patterns of social advantage being inherited (as all societies see to some extent). 

There is always a distribution of power in any setting you look at, and it’s never equal. This is not some utopian switch between utopia and capitalism. What changes here is the structure in which resources like land and leadership or management of organisations such as business are allocated and controlled. How is a factory run? How is a local government run? Who controls a river? And so forth. And the system of management has enormous material impact; or no one would care about questions around property. 

Then ultimately, socialist will argue, those who control politics; what logic do they make decisions on? What is their aim? 

The core promise of socialism (Marxist/classless or not) is that the economy will be shaped, organised, and regulated by human agency so as to serve society and human needs.

For example. Let’s say we start with everyone neutral and everyone gets allocated an equal and fair X amount of food. 


Then let’s say one person starts selling his food (so he eats less than everyone else) and in return he collects pieces of paper IOUs. Then let’s say after a year he has enough IOUs to do something like get labor help to build his own farm. Then with that farm he starts overtaking everyone else in terms of being able to produce his own food. 


Well now you have classism in a sense. Who decides how much food to allocate? Who decides if this person can do what they did with selling food and building their own farm? Who decides on how to stop this person if they feel it’s classism?


People who say want a classless system will say that the people in general should decide but direct democracy with everyone voting on everything doesn’t work. And if it were the case , we would actually probably never have passed LGBTQ rights back in the day.

As others have pointed out, you are probably looking for an explanation from a socialist; classless societies are one of their big goals.

...but I'll give you the closest 'liberal answer' that I can.

-----------

The best definitions of 'classes' are probably:

* **Upper Class:** Can live on investment income, alone.
* **Middle Class:** Needs to work in order to earn enough income, but can/does gain wealth from investments.
* **Working Class:** Near zero investment income. They make money from labor, alone.
* **Lower Class:** Includes the working class, but also people who don't make enough income from labor.

-----------

The middle class has expanded dramatically over the last century.

If a “classless society” were my goal, I would aim for *further* expanding the middle class as much as possible.

post_22,post_22_17,"I think the idea of a classless society is nice, but unworkable. The best we can do, and IMO probably what most proponents of socialism or social democracy are advocating, is a society where the rich are not obscenely, inhumanly wealthy (i.e. no billionaires- I mean, a 20 yo billionaire could spend nearly 35k *every day* if they live to 100, and that's only including the principal); everyone has equal access to justice (reduced police abuses of power, publicly funded legal aid, restorative justice instead of incarceration for NV offenders, etc), free quality healthcare for all, free quality education for all who want it, and regulatory barriers preventing businesses from dumping the costs of environmental harm on taxpayers. Im sure there are other points but those would be the biggies. 

As for paying for women on dates, my policy was that as a man, you insist on paying on the first date. It shows generosity and allows you to say ""you get the next one"" as an end run around asking for a second date. If she's really keen on gender equity (or really emphatic that there won't be a second date) she can insist on separate checks.

post_22,post_22_21,"So according to Marxism, our society has two main classes: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The first own the ""means of production"", and the second own only their labor. The means of production refers to resources and tools that, through labor, can be turned into useful products or services. This can be things like raw resources, factories, shipping vessels, all the way to proprietary software nowadays. The bourgeoisie make their money from selling stuff other people made, basically. 

One class owns the stuff, the other works with the stuff, according to Marxism. Everything about socioeconomic class you mentioned is pretty irrelevant. If the baker is selling the cakes he made, he's proletariat. If he buys a commercial bakery and pays other people to make cakes for his company to sell, he becomes bourgeoisie.

Marxists, then, advocate taking the means of production and giving them directly to the proletariat. Everyone at the cake factory would own it jointly and share the profits of their labor. There would be no class divisions, since everyone would be proletariat. In theory since the workers are now running society, they would structure it to their interests and needs, not the bourgeoisie, making a society that works for everyone.

Now, you can argue that these are still ambivalent or unmotivated or low information voters. But I think it's a little different than the middle. Maybe not so much.

3. But, Trump is [nearly as unpopular](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/) as Biden.  The race will likely be decided by how voters who disapprove of both candidates end up breaking.

post_23,post_23_8,"Biden.
I'm European, and I have a degree in American Studies and follow American politics closely 

While Biden is unpopular, a lot of people who voted for him didn't vote for him because they liked him but because they hated Trump, are Democrats, or just because of the fact that any Democrat is better than a Republican.

The state Republican Parties in a number of swing states are in trouble, many lack money. The Arizona GOP had to sell their headquarters because they didn't have the money to pay the rent, and the Michigan GOP might go bankrupt because of their money trouble. That's a problem because state parties are important for elections, and the lawsuits have cost them a lot of money. The National GOP might have to bail them out, and that, combined with paying Trump's legal fees, makes it even worse.

Trump also doesn't have many good allies in swing states.
In Pennsylvania, the Democrats have a popular Senator up for re-election and, a pretty popular governor, and another reasonably popular Senator.
In Michigan, they have a popular governor, two Senators, and an open senate seat with a strong candidate.
In Wisconsin, they have a reasonably popular governor and a very popular Senator up for re-election. The Republican Senator is pretty unpopular, and while he has won re-election, it was by a very small margin, whereas the Democrat won her last election handedly.
Nevada has two Democratic Senators, one up for re-election, with the likely GOP candidate being weaker than in the last election, where the Dems won. While the state has a republican governor, he is relatively moderate and has tried to distance himself from Trump, so he likely won't help much.
In Arizona, the reasonably popular governor is a Democrat, one senator is a Democrat, the other independent (elected as a dem) that caucuses with the Dems, and an open Senate race that leans Democratic given the fact the Republican is crazy and the Democrat is a relatively strong candidate. The former Republican Governor also has a bad relationship with Trump after he acknowledged Biden's victory in the state, so he won't help, abortion is also on the ballot, which might help Biden.
In Georgia, both senators are Democrats (both reasonably popular), and while the governor is a Republican, he has a frosty relationship with Trump for acknowledging Biden's win in the state, so he probably won't help much either.

post_23,post_23_19,"I think Biden probably wins. Opinion polls at this time suggest he loses. And if it were some new challenger, I think he'd be in trouble.


But I'm not sure Trump wins back anyone. Like how many of these Wisconsin/Michigan/Pennsylvania voters are going Trump 16, Biden 20, Trump 24? I'm sure those people are out there, but I can't imagine there's many of them.


Notably, I think Jan 6 hurt Trump more than anyone realizes. My anecdotal evidence is my dumb-as-shit Trump supporter cousin, who proudly voted for him in 16 and 20, has said he won't vote for him in 24 because of Jan 6. He won't vote for Biden either, so he'll just stay home.


So break it down...


Trump 16, Trump 20, likely goes Trump 24. This group isn't losing many voters, but Jan 6 may have made a small difference. Their alternative is going to be not voting in 24. Though I'd love to chat with a person who ends up Trump/Trump/Biden. 


Hillary 16, Biden 20, likely goes Biden 24. I don't think this group loses many voters. I'd be very curious to meet a Hillary/Biden/Trump voter. Rejected Trump twice, but 3rd time's a charm? There's some Israel related blow back on Biden in this group. But this is also the group that has been either Democratic loyalists or holding their nose to fight Trump since 2016. 


Trump 16, Biden 20, likely goes Biden 24 or doesn't vote. These voters rejected Trump once already. Trump/Biden/Trump would be a very odd pattern - if you've already rejected Trump, and you also want to reject Biden, I'd imagine you don't vote. 


Hillary 16, Trump 20, likely go Trump 24. I'm not sure how large this group is, but these people clearly changed their mind and thought Trump was doing a good job.


Either 16, didn't vote 20. Those people likely don't vote again. They rejected both options in 20 and it's the same choice in 24. 


Didn't vote 16, either 20. Either stick to their choice or don't vote. If you didn't vote in 16 and voted for Trump, likely you felt he was doing a good job. If you didn't vote in 16, and voted for Biden in 20 then likely you had a concern about Trump. My guess is this is the demographic that will tell us who wins. 


Didn't vote 16 or 20, for the sake of completion, I'd guess most of this group continues to note vote.


Biden voters weren't necessarily Biden supporters, but rather Trump haters. That's not usually a way to win an election, but Trump created a very unique set of circumstances.

post_23,post_23_47,"Trump has effectively *zero* chance at winning fairly.  Keyword *fairly*.  However, as our general presidential election isn't fair to begin with (EC, FPTP, etc.), that changes the odds significantly.  

I think Biden will still win, given that Trump hasn't yet won a popular vote, and managed to lose the second election and even caused others to lose in 2022.  I can't fathom how he could've possibly *gained* any new support, but then again, another anomaly was that in 2020, he managed to *gain* support after 4 years of insanity.  It's so hard to process how stupid and forgetful people are in this country.  

That being said, since he's also on trial and there are at least *some* people who have realized from this trial - the supposedly weakest one - that he pulled one over people's eyes in 2016, there's hope that people are done with the ""baggage"" as they had also said in 2022 after getting shellacked and there being no ""red wave"" then, in much part, on his behalf.  

The caveat is, he already tried to steal an election, and the fucked up thing is, every single major player who participated in that scheme (minus Navarro) is still free as a bird, and able to engage in more fuckery, with the mistakes of the past registered to learn from.  The more sensible ones will stay away from it, knowing Trump is at the front end of it again (""Mierdas touch""), but we've learned from history that hasn't stopped anyone from trying to use him for money or power or fame, anyway.  

So I expect fuckery, especially if he loses, but I think he will try some new scheme we haven't thought of, since no one saw ""fake electors"" nor an actual violent insurrection in 2020 as a possibility.

The Warren Court said that wasn't allowed and I, being a disabled atheist, am very grateful.

But the locals weren't going to abide the Warren ruling so the Feds had to step in and do a lot of restructuring and centralizing. While I do not doubt that this has been a negative for rural areas, doing nothing wasn't an option.

>More importantly, is a social safety net that doesn't screw over all the other people a thing rural people will accept?

Yeah because despite mainstream views to the contrary rural folks are pretty diverse with a sizable number counties in Southern single digit electoral college states having a higher percentage black population than New York City. On top of that they disproportionately volunteer for military services and are subject to the same degrees of disability from that. On top of the general disability and hardship that come from physically demanding jobs. Which dominate rural spaces. The idea every rural person is a evangelical Christian is as laughable as the idea that every Californian is a socialist.

>So how do we de-centralize social safety net services to help rural America without screwing over all the other people

Simple. Allocated equal funding to rural hospitals. You could even do a hybrid model of hospitals getting a baseline regardless of location and then an additional amount on a per patient in their service area (rounded to the nearest 5,000) basis. Which could reopen all of the rural hospitals that are getting closed. Or at the very least reopen wings and units that have either been shuttered or criminally understaffed. That way we don't have people traveling 5 hours to deliver a baby in a maternity ward, or see about their heart attack, or have a broken bone reset, or even in some cases get basic physicals and care.

In that same vain utilize already existing public structures that can be supplemented with mobile treatment options. Run clinics out of high schools on the weekends. Hell even if you had a rotation that a bus with nurses, doctors, an X ray machine and maybe even an MRI machine set up in a high school gym one Saturday in a two month cycle you could cover the entire population without any real additional infrastructure. You could even have school bus drivers pick up people and bring them to that location since those routes and areas are already pretty well planned out.

You could even raise additional money for it by combining Medicaid and Medicare (as well as potentially aspects of the VA, but that's a much more complicated process) and eliminate all of their administrative bloat and hire more doctors, nurses, and technicians. Or even just sell any of the number of minor tax increases to rural folks because for once we have a very clear example of what their money is going towards not just a clinic 5 hours away that is by all practical means inaccessible.

It's not that difficult to actually address rural folks' issues.",0.0571500074916671,0.0158416032791137,0.4991508722305298,0.0018496513366699,0,0

No, I called the people who send death threats to doctors freak jobs. And the people who would no doubt jail an OB-GYN for telling a woman not to carry a non-viable fetus to term freak jobs. I called the people who supported this nonsense by choosing to elevate freak jobs to power freak jobs.

What other term would you use?

But I don't object to them getting medical care via social services if they can find people who will voluntarily be doctors in these places.

I do object however to the notion that this mess isn't partially of their own making. You can't dox and threaten pro-vaccine doctors and expect them to stay. You can't write abortion laws that are so strict and the life of the mother exception be so narrow that it may as well not exist and expect the OB-GYNs not to run for the hills in fear. And you can't vote for people who are publicly against social services and proceed to be mad that you don't get social services.

I've been in the disability community for years and it still mystifies me when these rural special needs family members vote for people who are loudly and proudly against the services their family members use and then get mad when their family members get put on the chopping block. I really have trouble understanding how they were expecting something else other than that they seriously thought *their* family would be spared somehow.

Big states and urban areas didn't make the small states and rural areas do this. They made that choice themselves.

And these solutions you propose are smart. And rural America does have a choice now and they always have, contrary to what some may believe. They can vote for people who want to implement solutions. Or they can vote for culture warriors who will take the budget ax to whatever is left of rural healthcare and call it ""small government.""

Because that was definitely every single rural person and not the basic level of nut jobs that just exist. You know like the people that have threatened to dox and kill the Trump jurors if they don't find him guilty. Or maybe we could not lump large groups in with their crazy elements.

As for what term we could use? I don't know maybe idiots or you could keep dehumanizing and othering them because fuck those people right?

You're right they didn't make people in those spaces so those things, nor did small states make big states hord and centralize social services because once again fuck those people right?

Your experiences are your own and they affect you and how you see the world, you have to understand that's the same for other people too.

One thing I think is noteworthy with most Americans is that they find it super annoying and not at all useful when someone they didn't ask starts telling them ""I've been through way more than you, life is way harder for me, so all your problems are dumb and stupid and don't matter. You didn't go through what I went through so you have no right to complain.""

No one fuckin asked you, and your only argument is ""I've had it worse. I've had it worse."" Well fuck me then I guess all my problems aren't really problems.

What the hell do you even think you're accomplishing by telling people their life isn't that bad?

I get it you volunteer and work with underpriveledged kids convincing them their lives could be better.

It's obvious from the tone of your posts that you're exasperated with people around you not ""appreciating America enough."" Not everyone needs you to tell them how much they should appreciate their own world. Not everyone's issues can just be swept under the rug with a wave of the ""I've had it worse"" wand. Not everyone needs to be told by you that they're fuckin doing it wrong. Help those in need--your students and those you volunteer for--and leave the rest of us to figure out our own shit.

It's gotten way harder to keep food stamps for example. Or applying for and continuing on Section 8 is such a big hassle. 

Basically the idea is that we live in such a prosperous and powerful country that no one here should have to struggle. This preoccupation with trying to force everyone to ""earn their right to live"" comes across more and more as a disingenuous mode of thought designed to prevent a growing section of Americans from reaching true prosperity. There's a sore spot with people in being told that you'll make it if you just try harder.

Some people have medical bills they can't afford and so they can't work. Basic medical shouldn't be so incredibly expensive. Basic childcare is so expensive it's not worth it to work because you almost have to pay a whole wage just to afford someone watching your kid.

The thing is not everyone can have the high paying job. It's more and more competitive and you have to be extra special and more extra special. Where is security for those who work hard, work two jobs and raise kids, but aren't super talented or social or especially intelligent? The ""earn your keep"" thought process is designed to discount those disadvantages. The ""I had it worse"" card is also designed to preclude empathy in favor of practicality. Because you did something doesn't mean someone else can do it and that in turn doesn't mean someone else shouldn't get the same access to happiness that you have. 

For that mode of thought has allowed greedy politicians and the like to justify gutting or neglecting necessary services like disability, social security, Medicare, etc. the idea being that if we make necessities too accessible, people won't just force themselves to work harder to earn the same quality of life",0.0958476095044392,0.0086789727210998,0.4997355043888092,1.7762184143066406e-05,0,0

More common, though still quite rare, is a single party government which almost has a majority being propped up by a small party which has just enough seats to push them over the line. They don't get an official say in government but they'll usually get some favourable funding considerations.

A recent example of that was 2017-2019, when the Conservative party was 9 seats short of a majority and they made an agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (a hard right, religious oriented Northern Irish party) who had won 10 seats.

post_24,post_24_25,"Recently, I've learned two hot takes for Reddit:

* Birth rates below the replacement rate (2.1 children per woman) combined with an aging populace are a serious issue
   * Though, it seems to be really hard to find strong long-term solutions because short-term boost in birth rates might easily lead to economic disaster in 40-60 years
   * Young people are especially screwed by demographic dynamics because more and more pressure will be put on them regarding social safety nets and senior pensions (at least in many European countries) and thus taxation
      * These current dynamics seems to be one of the reasons why current democracies favor older generations. Old people tend to rely on state subsidies more (they don't and anymore cannot work) than young people who usually just want to have equal opportunities and be left to live their lives their own way.
      * So old people (who are getting bigger in numbers recently) are incentivized to push for policies favoring them and hurting young people because their living standards depend on it
      * And young people get increasingly fed up with the democratic system of decision-making because it f's them and doesn't help solving their own issues
* Immigrants need to learn the language and be willing to work
   * To preface it: I am all for open borders.
   * If an immigrant isn't willing to work, they don't contribute anything to the society they migrated into.
   * If an immigrant isn't willing to learn the majority language, they will have much harder time living in the society they migrated into.
      * An American coming to my country, Czechia, and not willing to learn Czech will likely be retreating to a English-speaking expat community and essentially become an outsider in the country they live in.
      * In Czechia, we can easily see this issue with old Vietnamese generations themselves living in rather secluded Vietnamese community while their children and grand-children are encouraged to learn Czech (kinda had to due to education system) so they can live better lives here

My old personal, and dusty, hot take:

* Modern liberal monarchies would work better than modern democracies
   * Admittedly, I have a romanticized view on medieval ages
   * The issue with democracy is misinformed voters hold the most decision-making influence, therefore, making it easier for some threats to exist (eg. populism, the threat of a democracy turned authoritarian by ""the will of the people""). 
   * But in the contrast, good-quality democracy supposes well-informed voters are in the majority and thus, would ultimately prevail over misinformed voters. 
   * In a monarchy, the monarch is incentivized to put themselves at the front but also, they need to ""bribe"" the common populace with good policies (that might have long-term nature) while democratic leaders usually ""bribe"" the common populace with short-term gifts and unfulfilled unrealistic promises
      * Also, a monarch (and their families) is supposed to be educated in statecraft while democratic leaders could easily be some random sh\*theads like Trump.
   * To be frank, I've never tried to figure out a strong checks-and-balances system but I dare to say it could be invented.

Might have long-term nature, sure, but don't usually - for almost the same reason it's that way in a democracy (you want to throw the people a bone so they don't raze your castle, but that's basically it). But the difference is that in a democracy, the leaders have to get the support of their people, while a monarch only needs its obedience. Obedience can also be ensured with repression

Don't worry, I've got plenty of disagreement here in the past regarding the first 2 hot takes.

>Obedience can also be ensured with repression 

I think this is an outdated anti-monarchist opinion. Liberal monarchies wouldn't need to rely on repression to the degree democratic-minded people seem to suggest. They would mostly rely on good long-term policies. The incentive is clear. Good long-term policies ensure a good economy and thus happy people who won't feel the need to rebel against the crown.

Also, in democracies, political leaders rarely get the support of the people. It's usually the biggest minority ruling over others. Actually, more often than not, non-voters are the biggest chunk of the population.

And it's not like people nowadays don't feel repressed in democracies. For example, the sentiment against mainstream media is mostly the feeling of being repressed by liberally-minded democrats (not meaning the US party).

>A democratic leader goes through an approval process

The approval doesn't equal quality statecraft.

Trump is an example. There are plenty of incompetent political leaders in democracies, at rates that one might easily lose faith in humanity (and democracy).

And that a politician is in power for 8-10 years doesn't mean they became good at statecraft. Monarch being educated in that makes it much more probable.",0.0304204721462267,0.0077629685401916,0.4997602701187134,0.0008551180362701,0,0
post_24,post_24_25_3,"Adding to your first point, which is very true indeed: We have to significantly cut retirement benefits for people without children. There is simply no longer an incentive to have any kids at all. The costs of raising kids are individual, the benefits of having them are nationalized. The costs of not having kids are also widely nationalized. If you don't have kids, you also don't have to worry about your inheritance. You can just blow out all of your earnings towards the end of your life and then have the government step in to pay for your assisted living, if the need arises. My parents had to bear those costs for their parents AND have to worry about what they're leaving for me and my sister.

  
The fact that nobody questions this system is wild to me. It borders insanity and destroys my faith in democracy.

 

Average life expectancy has also risen drastically. Over here in Germany we spend an annual 1.1 trillion Euros in social spending, two thirds of which are just retirees, strongly disproportional health care costs, retirement and state pensions. That's about 700-800 billion annually. This is the same amount the US spends for its entire armed forces, discretionary spending and otherwise. Germany's boomers cost as much as the entire US military. (Our economy is a sixth of yours) 

Let that sink in. 

  
And I do think the boomers really feel they are entitled to endless wealth and growth, without bearing any of the burdens, be that in raising children or paying taxes.

My cousin's neighbor is a boomer engineer who constantly complains about how lazy Gen Z is and asks who's gonna pay for his retirement. Guess how many kids this fucker has. Exactly: Zero. Doesn't like immigration either and he has a very high standard of living. If you bring any of this up with a boomer, even those who did have two kids, they usually get extremely defensive and start deflecting.

People like that engineer must get fucked hard and get a reality check, asap.

Unfortunately, it is a vicious cycle, like you mentioned. If we can't break out of this downward spiral I really fear that we are fucked.

Young people see the prospect of increasing pressure on higher taxation (eg. retirement contributions) with aging population as something not to look forward to (a hindrance of their own economic wellbeing). Heck, I remember 20 years ago how older people were telling us children that we won't enjoy the retirement and we stupidly laughed it off.

post_24,post_24_26,"We also have the unique right to utilize guns for self defense. 


The issue with the gun control argument is always that it focuses on gun crime and gun deaths and throughly discounts gun utility in like the form of self defense. 


But why does it need to be a right? Because otherwise local and State governments will (despite your personal assurances that you don’t want an gunless society) make it such that it’s impossible for people to own guns for self defense. It’s like asking the question - why does / did abortion or LGBTQ, etc need to be protected as part of the Bill of Rights? Because otherwise States can effectively ban it. 


Take for example New York. Just 10 years ago it was impossible for the average person to have a gun (any gun) for self defense even at home or within their place of business. You had cases where people had been robbed and attacked and injured multiple times at their business or in their home and New York still denied them gun permits. It was effectively a ban. Meanwhile the governor could have a gun for self defense. His body guards could have guns for self defense. So could the mayor. So did Trump have a gun also. Without it being a right - you get classism. 


It was only after Heller and Bruen cases that the Federal Courts determined that New York was actually trampling on the rights of the common person in being able to own a gun for self defense - that New York was forced to allow such. 


But don’t take my word for it. Read it from the largest association of New York black / minority public defenders:


https://www.bronxdefenders.org/supreme-court-strikes-down-the-carry-provision-of-new-york-states-gun-licensing-scheme/


Things that are not rights lead to classism and discrimination. 


But also that doesn’t mean that rights are unlimited. The first amendment isn’t unlimited. You can’t just threaten someone with no consequence. Same for guns.

post_24,post_24_42,"I believe Dan Rather was setup by Sumner Redstone at CBS. Redstone was the chairman of Viacom. Viacom had acquired more assets and was being forced by regulation to spin off CBS. Although Redstone was allegedly liberal, he made news before the 2004 election, when telling his peers that he would endorse President Bush. 

After the election, the FCC attempted to change regulations without giving the required public notice. Redstone had lobbied for this change in the hope that it wouldn't be necessary to spin off CBS. But news of the regulation changes spread online and both sides of the aisle were angry about it. This was effective because the FCC backed down and Viacom was forced to spin off CBS. 

Unfortunately, the FCC later did change the rules (I think while Trump was President) and they did it without a whimper, this time. Viacom immediately rolled CBS back under it's wing afterwards.

Regardless of whether the story that got Rather fired was true or false, I think Redstone made a deal for it to happen, in a failed attempt to save Viacom from splitting. And it would have worked had news of the changes not leaked, causing an uproar from both sides. I watched C-SPAN the morning after the news broke and people were extremely angry about it. Now ask yourself who would benefit from Rather's story being labeled as untrue, which would cost him his job at CBS?",0.0268739939864517,0.0740334391593933,0.4997170269489288,0.0004035532474517,0,0

post_24,post_24_44,"Maybe not a hot take but every political leaning is understandable. As in, even if someone's logic is flawed, there is almost always a line that you can trace from them that eventually winds back to ""I think this will make the world better for more people"". Huge asterisk there, because obviously there are unconscious biases and perspectives that change what someone thinks a better world would look like. But I try to recognize that, on a very fundamental level, most of the people I disagree with politically in my life are decent people who are willing to stick their necks out for others. The main takeaway being that you can still take valuable lessons and ideas from ideologies you vehemently disagree with. 

For example, I am not and never will be a Nazi sympathizer, but I try to recognize that the Nazis took root and were successful because there were factors at play that made many Germans feel supporting Hitler was the way to a better and happier world at the time, or at least a better and happier Germany. Flawed af logic, morals and means, but on some level you have to remind yourself that people believe things because of other things they had no control over influencing their psychology, just like you! So you shouldn't necessarily agree with them, but you shouldn't mindlessly hate and disregard them either.

Decrim doesn’t accomplish that because there would be no legal market; transactions would still occur in gray or illicit markets.

She couldn't and is now addicted to meth and who knows what else.

It’s slightly better now, but it’s still primarily geared at scaring people out of trying drugs instead of allowing them to make an informed decision. 

And for a lot of people, it **is** based in reason because they’re trying to escape the reality that they live in and the bit of reprieve they get while high makes an otherwise painful existence tolerable!

Take, for example, smoking. Those are fact driven campaigns to inform people about potential side effects of smoking and tobacco use, and smoking rates are the lowest they’ve been in history!

Along with legalization, taxes would (and should) be used for mental health and addiction services as well as Safe Consumption Sites.

Lastly, most people move on to “higher grade stuff” because of tainted supply, not because they want to. Yes, tolerance is a thing, but it can be mitigated by making sure folks using heroin are using heroin rather than heroin cut with fentanyl, ultimately leading them to fentanyl altogether.

Oh, also, Big Tobacco deceiving consumers was a regulatory issue, but they fixed the regulations and you no longer see that as prevalently, and certain types of advertising is banned altogether.

The Russians wanted to vote in Gennady Zyuganov and a social democratic system similar to Austria or Sweden (which was literally his campaign promise), while the Neoliberals decided to support Boris Yeltsin and even did a whole Times Magazine spread about interfering in the election and helping him win even though was hated more than Stalin by Russians, which is a literal quote in the article.  His American advisors were even asked to tell him to call off the election if he was going to lose, which is another quote in the article. 

The belief among Russians is that Yeltsin didn't even win the election and the results were faked. It's a bit misleading to not mention the whole blatant interference in the 1996 elections and why they gave up on democracy. For example, when Pompeo says 'We lied, we cheated, we stole' he means in Bolivia where they sponsored a coup against Evo Morales... in Bolivia.

This is hardly democracy. Advertising it as Russians have to live in Yeltsin's oligarchic hell of a Russia forever is not a serious attempt. Does the Times Magazine article instill faith in democracy among Russians, do we think they can't read it because its in English?

Isn't forcing poor people on expensive, time consuming, and ineffective dialysis which will kill them when we could give them a kidney exploitation?


>Like people will feel forced to go threw surgery and recovery to survive

So we force them to do dangerous work instead? The death rate for kidney donation is 3 out of 10,000. The average death rate for a US worker is 3.7 across professions. Logging is 100 deaths, construction 38,  and farmers 20. 

Letting people skip a year or two of work by selling a kidney would save lives and dramatically decrease their risk of death. Forcing poor people into dangerous logging camps instead because they can't sell their kidney is exploitation and murder

Thats my point. 

We’re saying ‘it’s authoritarianism for the government to impede on a parents ability to be an authoritarian towards their child’ 

We do not consider children to be worthy of freedom. Thus, children being made more free is being seen as authoritarian. 

Its being treated as a given that children are not to be free. 

As society becomes more liberated, theres a chance that that view will age horrendously

The government isnt making the child less free by stopping their parents’ authoritarianism. Thus, the government isnt being authoritarian.

* Fame seeking
* Direct copycat of another shooting

I guess it would depend. Anything that makes the shooting make the news more fuels the next shooter, so maybe yes, in order to save the lives of children. Any rights violation is allowed as long as it's to save the children, right? 

>Our attitude toward guns wasn’t the same back then as it is now.

It's changed quite a bit. For example, you've moved to wanting to ban the scary looking rifles. Back in the 1960s much of the gun control that existed was often in reaction to black people owning and carrying guns (such as the Black Panthers). 

>Back then there wasn’t this militant push to expand gun rights and push them into as many public spaces as possible. 

Back then the gun control people weren't pushing so hard. What you see as a ""militant push"" is a reaction to a strong effort to encroach on the rights of the people. It isn't a coincidence that the same decade the Sixth Circuit finalized the new ""collective right"" theory that let the government violate the right as much as it wanted is the decade that the push against gun control really cranked up. 

>I have long said that instead of changing the laws, we need to change the culture and do to guns what we did to cigarettes and drunk driving.

The reality is that a decent quality gun, ammunition, and range time all cost money. Most people working the types of jobs you're referring to can't afford any of that.

The career criminal who's already been in and out of prison is not going to care at all about the illegality of buying a gun, so he will buy one. And then he will use it against the now defenseless person above. 

The problem is, it's the criminal above who's committing most of the gun violence, and he's not deterred. You only deter those least likely to commit gun violence. 

As far as ""why have any laws,"" that's easy. I love it when you people say ""Then why have laws against murder?"" There are two kinds of laws, malum in se (illegal because it's inherently evil) and malum prohibitum (illegal only because the government says so). 

These kinds of gun laws are malum prohibitum, victimless crimes. People still want to do it because they know it's not inherently evil. They're along the lines of the old sodomy laws. Sex between consenting homosexual adults isn't inherently evil, but the government made it illegal anyway. So you don't want sodomy laws? ""Why have any laws?""

No fault because the context was criminal activity. This isn't just official gang members, who do commit a lot of the gun violence. It's the average criminal. Over a third of murderers were on probation or parole from a felony, even more from a misdemeanor (as in pleaded down). Even more were off that status at the time of the murder, and even more had a lengthy arrest record. 

People with such criminal histories make up a small minority of our population, yet they commit the majority of murders. 

One interesting thing I found when reading the statistics on Milwaukee long ago is that the victim profile is very criminal too. One fifth of victims were themselves on probation or parole, and two thirds had an arrest record, usually lengthy. Other large cities aren't going to be very different.

I've seen some of those dodgy statistics. This is especially true since you add ""unknown"" in there, nice try. Most victims know their attackers. This is especially common since most criminals know the other criminals, so they end up knowing those criminals who shoot them. Quite often one of these inter-criminal shootings is due to perceived or real insult, so of course the victim knows the shooter.

post_25,post_25_14,"1. Eliminate concentration of wealth in the hands of a few. We have no shortage of food, housing, education, healthcare, and general infrastructure but for the policies baked into our statutes through regulatory capture. 

This sounds impossible but the U.S. has accomplished substantial retrenchment of concentrated wealth twice in the last 140 years. The first time was Teddy Roosevelt breaking up the business trusts. 

The second time was under FDR. 

Social Security cut the death rate of over 60 year olds by 70%. Not that hard when the primary causes of death for that age bracket was exposure in the winter & starvation in the summer. 

The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 
1. Set 40 hours in 7 days as the work week.
2. Created overtime compensation for work more than 40 hrs/wk.
3. Established the minimum wage.
4. Abolished child labor. Nobody under 16 (farm work excluded) could work for a private employer. Mom & Pop shops were watched. 
5. Created the Unemployment Compensation System that required states to adopt legislation in order to participate. 

One day you went to sleep in 1938 where you worked 80-100 hours at the bakery or in the mine/factory along side of 12 & 13 year olds. The next day the children were prohibited from working, your work week was cut to 40 hours, you had an income that permitted you to have a reasonable standard of living, and if the bakery burned down you could collect unemployment while looking for another job!

One thing that impressed me is that they have compulsory individual financial savings--not just tons of public housing (which btw even with 90% public housing they STILL are in a housing shortage and having price issues, so building more public housing isn't THE ONLY ingredient needed to solve that issue like so many folks seem to think).

I think the concept of an antidote to ""this is why we can't have nice things"" really hit me when I realized that this wet, tropical, hot, humid island country had NO bugs--even along the river--and it turns out it's because whoever is responsible for a property gets fined each time and increasingly if bugs are found--this IS important bc of dengue fever risks--but also a microcosm of how it's not actually that big of a deal to enforce rules if it is decided that that is the M.O.--this country now requires that developers replace 100% of developed land footprint with reciprocal greenspace in the design by law--without controlling something like bugs this would be a nightmare--in NYC it would be waterbug city.

This country definitely misses out on some civil liberties and freedom of speech--I'm not sure how a society can be built to allow dissent but also enforce quality of life laws that--like managing bugs  therefore having ample greenspaces bc they are manageable--do amount to systemic differences in our shared environment for the better, despite how I would imagine folks would overlook these quality of life issues in the shadow of individual rights on all sides of the political spectrum, both freedom from govt and freedom from law enforcement.",0.0290349136320847,0.0169644355773925,0.4997390210628509,3.552436828613281e-05,0,1

Paxton avoids jail through political power. It has been nine years since he was indicted for securities fraud and he still hasn't even gone to trial. In March, he cut a deal with prosecutors to have his charges dropped and avoid a jury, after he flipped one witness and another literally died of old age.

post_25,post_25_65,">Examples would be banning certain speech 


We might have a different understanding of the word ""authoritarian"", but okay... 


I have a lot of speech I believe should be banned. Probably most importantly, direct calls to criminal activity, especially orders to commit criminal acts; then, deliberately false statements under oath and deliberately false defamatory statements to police; abuse of emergency signals, for instance SWATting; using speech to commit a crime through an unwitting proxy (imagine a doctor telling a patient they have to take medication X once a day to survive, with the intention of having the patient die of an overdose of the once-a-month medication: I think that is and should be banned); deliberate deception for personal gain; unwanted violation of privacy; and then, less importantly than either of those, I also agree with us (Germany) criminalizing holocaust denial, the riling up of masses, and Nazi propaganda.

I will never defend the current application of the Second Ammendment in my country. I know this might sound weird, but I don't want to live in a community in which owning and carrying guns is seen as normal. I do want to legalize owning ""bludgeon"" which the police is already able to use and, of course, pepper spray or any self defense equipment. 

Every citizen has the right to proportionally defend him or herself. I can't comprehend why Americans want to have guns while school shootings happen. Maybe that's something exclusively American that you want to be part of your ""values"". Maybe, if this were true, I'm in this aspect ""anti-American"", as I'll happily take a lack of owning guns over the scare of children be shot at in school. Call me authoritarian but I would never allow a Second Ammendment to take of. I much rather invest in a stronger police force than have individual gun ownership.

post_26,post_26_0,"The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.

So there's something that's been troubling me a lot over the past few months.

How much democratic control actually exists over the federal bureaucracy? I.e. how much policy is actually set by unelected bureaucrats?

See, here's the thing. A couple months back I watched this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWxh2oS7Ays&t=20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWxh2oS7Ays&t=20s)

And I found it fascinating. I've also spent a great deal of time over the past few months reading up on various abuses of federal power during the cold war and war on terror, which has helped drive me to be a touch paranoid lol.

This lack of democratic oversight and the strong influence of the federal bureaucracy on actual decision making is something that's fundamentally anti-democratic no? Career bureaucrats building empires within their own departments and ""advising"" the politicians that we elect to help them in that quest.

I mean, the old british sitcom *Yes Minister* is based around slight exaggerations of true stories from the british government and its civil service and it's shocking the extent to which the civil service influences democratic policy via empire building.

My dad is a right libertarian and he's convinced that the civil service and broader federal bureaucracy really is a ""deep state"" that sets policy outside of democratic oversight (and cause he's a right wing shit head, of course that means that they were just anti-trump). But like... he does kind of have a point. Federal bureaucrats did actively thwart a number of trump's policies. And, like, that's obviously a good thing in the short term cause those policies were terrible. But like.... I'm not generally a fan of bureaucrats snatching documents off a president's desk so they don't sign them (though I'm also not a fan of a president who forgets about documents unless they are literally in front of him).

A big part of project 2025 is the idea that the federal bureaucracy should more or less be under the direct control of the president. Now, obviously, that's bad as well because it invests a whole lot of power in the hands of the executive and that could very very easily be abused. I mean it's basically an elected dictator (and dictators don't tend to tolerate elections long anyways).

  
What I am wondering about though is: what actually is the right answer here? We shouldn't have bureaucrats setting policy without democratic oversight regardless of who is president. Empire building, corporations funding and regulating themselves via regulatory capture, all of that is like... bad.

And I'm not really sure what the actual solution is. Would it be better to transform the experts into advisory roles rather than in charge of actually implementing rules and then we could have elected councils to implement these rules? (So the EPA itself wouldn't set regulations, instead it would recommend them and then these would be voted on by subcouncils of elected delegates. You could hand this job to congress but given they only work for like half the year i doubt they'll be willing to do it). I'm not really sure.

  
tl;dr: How do we ensure the civil service doesn't interfere with democratic decision making? The examples of this interference are most egregious in the realm of foreign policy and national security, but bureaucratic empire building can be seen in every level of the federal bureaucracy no?

It's not unaccountable at all.  If an agency issues a new rulemaking, those with standing have the right to sue and the Courts get involved.  Congress also has the power to overturn rulemakings it does not like under the Congressional Review Act.

Each executive branch department has an independent Inspector General who has the job of investigating the department to find waste, bad actors (including illegal action), etc.  The Government Accountability Office does reports on how effective agencies are at different things.  Congress also has an Oversight Committee in each the House and the Senate that can investigate what they want, as well as other committees that can do the same for agencies under their purview.

It's also worth noting that these agencies were created with the power that they have because of bills passed by both houses in Congress and signed by the president.

>I mean look at the shit the CIA or FBI gets up to. Hell, the CIA hacked Dianne Feinstein's laptop WHILE SHE WAS INVESTIGATING THEM. That's clearly not good.

Yes, that is bad. And we know about it because Congress told us, both in hearings and through a 6,000 page report, IG investigations, oversight boards, etc., instead of just being ignored.

Bad things are always going to happen.  It's the reaction to those bad things that makes a difference.

>And like, fuck Trump and all, but are you honestly comfortable with bureaucrats setting policy by snatching papers or intentionally undermining presidential directives? I mean where is the actual accountability for that right?

Depends on the type of agency.  Independent agencies, for example, are designed explicitly to not follow the orders of the President or Congress, because those agencies have much more expertise in what they do.

>It's not neccessarily about the cabinet secretaries but the guys below them. Cabinet secretaries have a modicum of accountability, but the guys in the video were not cabinet secretaries or ever appointed by any democratic body right?

Many undersecretaries are appointed by the president and confirmed by Senate--these usually go very smoothly and quickly, and there's so many at the beginning of a new presidential term that there's not enough time to report on them all.

It's not really about ""trusting experts"". It's about the lack of democratic oversight within the enforcement and regulatory apparatus of state. It's not GoVeRnMeNt BaD or whatever. I'm just deeply uncomfortable with a large unaccountable body of people setting policy which have effectively no democratic oversight, like our CIA official previously mentioned.

>I don't give a flying fuck if the person that sets seat belt safety standards is elected. I care that they did the math.

I mean sure, but at the same time that's not really my concern. My general concern is that the civil service undermines democratic mandates by trying to maintain a status quo or expanding their departments. That's why I mentioned *Yes Minister*, as it tells many many stories like that.

For example, one of the episodes details a hospital that has no patients but is kept open because of civil service corruption. That's a problem right?

e.g. How I would handle it: 

If you ever talk about a social issue, bring on the arguments of project 2025. See if they agree or not. If they haven't read it yet, they'll be honest and you can simply state your opinion/convince them. You'll usually find a common ground or you can convince them if you're well read (usually, most people don't have the knowledge to debate/form a believable argument against a well read person), after which you state that it is from project 2025 which is funded and supported by official Republicans. 

------------------------------------------

There's only one thing you need to beware of: Do not lecture them. Debate, question their beliefs and explain your viewpoints. But do not lecture them. You're not in college and you're not talking to a political commentator, you're talking to your familiy. If they're interested, offer them interesting books/papers. But don't try to create a flood of information/facts/stats. It only results in them tuning out and stopping the conversation. 

I haven't fully read Project 2025 yet, but what I've read, makes me skeptical to say the least. I don't think they'll be able to pass the legislation they want and I don't think it will be \*the\* solution as they present it. 

e.g. Capital punishment

Capital punishment is NOT the solution for the rise in crime. I'm a proponent of a quick and painless capital punishment for the most heinous crimes, but it will not be the solution for the rise as they state it. So, basics we agree with but the argument we don't. 

e.g. Christian nationalism. 

Why should this even be a policy? The US is not inherently Christian, and christianity is not even one united thing... It has many different variations which don't even agree on basics like the Bible. (Protestants only have 66 books in the Bible.) Why should that be part of a nationalist, unifying agenda? I consider myself a nationalist/regionalist in my own, European country, but it's stupid to place ""Christian"" before it. Many have died over this religious conflict, and now they are going to state that Christianity is a unified or unifying religion? What a joke. (Oh, and what are we going to do with the Jews?

I mean he just simply can't, he can't pardon himself for the dozens of state felons he his facing.

One is handled in New York, the other in Georgia. Normally, you may correct me if I'm wrong, you'd suspect that Trump as president could postpone the business documents or pull it up to the SCOTUS.

I understand the concept of a ""pardon"", but I do not see a realistic implementation of it. Simply put: For every case in which it should've been used (e.g. Carter pardoning draft evaders), there will be 10 in which it shouldn't (e.g. Ford pardoning Nixon).

post_29,post_29_0,"The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.

Liberals have this idea that men and women are only the way they are because of social conditioning.

But when you look at certain statistics like the fact that [96.7% of Kindergarten teachers are women](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2024/02/12/over-96-of-kindergarten-teachers-are-women-research-shows-heres-how-to-attract-more-men/), that really makes me wonder. Is the idea that women don't have a natural aptitude with children despite being the sex that carries and gives birth to children and has the ability to feed children with their female organs?

Is there a problem with Early Education engaging in systemic discrimination against men? Seems unlikely.

Same with nursing, which is 88% women, according to that same article. Another profession that has to do with nurturing/caring/people-centric. This one doesn't have to do with children but the similarities are clear. Does the Nursing profession systemically discriminate against men too?

Was my 4 year old niece socially conditioned into liking dolls and pretty things, along with most other little girls? I'm not sure about that. I mean the least we can say is that the social conditioning doesn't take long at all, and this conditioning is very powerful because girls and boys seem to gravitate to these gendered things, despite only a short time of conditioning.

Another thing that makes me wonder regarding the social conditioning argument: \[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing_theory&oldid=515528642#Evolutionary_explanations_for_sex_differences)\]

>research on one-day-old babies has found that boys look longer at a mechanical mobile while girls look longer at a face. This, as well as the effects of fetal testosterone on later behavior, is argued to be evidence against the sex differences being only due to socialization.""

I don't know, I think this argument that sex differences are purely the result of social conditioning is one of the weaker liberal arguments.

Untrue. You would be hard pressed to find a liberal who believes that men and women are the way they are SOLELY due to social conditioning.

These statistics don't really discount the idea that women are socially conditioned to be caregivers, though. They might actually reinforce it.

I think it would be enormously difficult, in fact nearly impossible, to determine this. Nor do I think it's a particularly productive exercise.

I don't know why you would find that unlikely. As a man I am hesitant to be around children at all because of the kinds of accusations that fly. I've seen men be pretty actively counseled out of pursuing careers in Early Childhood Education.

The thing is is that all of those homes the husband did all the cooking. It never even occurred to my friend that that was the case because why would it? Not really something you think about.

So he’s at his in-laws and his daughter walks into the kitchen and she sees her father cooking. But she also sees her grandmother and her aunt cooking.

Yeah, there probably is some discrimination against men in nursing. The bigger issue is that for a long time, nursing and education were seen as women's jobs and it takes a long time for society to change from that view. Men don't become nurses or teachers of young children because men can't imagine themselves doing those jobs.

post_29,post_29_18_1_2,"To add the other comment, the best science can do is to say it’s a combination. You can’t (practically or ethically) raise a child in the absence of social conditioning. You can make small changes in a controlled environment, like showing kids pictures of possible careers either matching their gender or with typical gender coding and seeing if it changes how they answer questions about what they want to be when they grow up, but you can’t learn how much it matters overall. 

An experiment like that is overcoming the conditioning they’ve received, so what if they’d never been exposed to gendered expectations? Would additional representation of female engineers or male nurses have greater impact each time or diminishing returns? 

That’s before you get into what pieces of social conditioning and inherent differences, and their combinations, are having what affect. Are women not becoming engineers because they think they’re bad at it? Driven out by toxic company culture? Male-dominated fields are less receptive to working mothers? Do men think they’d be bad kindergarten teachers? They’d be looked down on? Never even consider it as an option?

You'd put a 2 year old girl in a dress even before they can express the desire to do so, but you wouldn't do the same with a boy.",0.0767341608876802,0.0071005821228027,0.4997024536132812,0.0186274051666259,0,1
post_29,post_29_27,"Child development professional here (bachelors in it and pending masters degree). There are no inherent skills women posses which make them better at caregiving, nor are there natural detriments for men who wish to pursue caregiving. What makes a good caregiver is someone who is patient, responsive, and connected - all of which are personality traits you can find in all genders and can also be learned in all genders. It is also notable to children require a lot of diversity in their caregivers to help them develop socially and emotionally - so not only is there no reason for men to avoid caregiving, it is actively positive when they do engage with it! 

The current disparity in childcare and education professions is because of social conditioning to see women as inherently gifted with providing care services and men as inherently unable to provide them - and this starts young. Before the age of 7 children have unparalleled neural growth and the patterns for the rest of their life are formed. Sexism is insidious and can be introduced nonchalantly, such as encouraging girls to only play with dolls or telling a young boy not to cry or hug his friends These interactions form the framework for the child’s sense of self, and if they are reinforced by other messages such as 1) only witnessing women providing care in the form of mothers, teachers, nurses, babysitters, etc, 2) only witnessing anger or stoic displays from important male figures, 3) consuming media where parenthood or caregiving is portrayed as a woman’s job, or 4) receiving interactions where the emotional male self is stunted in favor of aggression or bullying tactics — then their “social script” has been written and their brain will create pathways accordingly. Many women feel expected to seek out such careers or bringing caregiving into other places, and many men feel as though they cannot care for children because they have not been given the social and emotional tools to do so. These subconscious early associations show up as “gut feelings” and impulses or reactions against anything other than the social norm. It is why people feel weird about men working with children. 

With all that in mind, it is unsurprising to me that men are shamed, chased out, and discouraged from taking on kindergarten lead teaching positions. Sexism demands that men live apart from children because it is “woman’s work”, and a society which follows a sexist standard react unkindly when they see anyone -  man, woman, or child - going against it.

an edit: it is also important to consider that many roles and careers branded as “women’s work” are historically underpaid and overworked, as well as the professionals in those places receiving a lot of abuse and stress. Many times you will find men in administrative positions such as principal, director, or lead counselor while the women occupy the teachers, caregivers, and social workers of these places - more work for less money. It is a structure which harkens back to the time of indentured servant nannies and wives who couldn’t vote, further demonizing men who wish to take an active role in the caregiving profession while also devaluing the role of women who already work there.",0.0873187747146531,0.0107984542846679,0.4997344315052032,0.952754646539688,0,0

You have offered nothing but shallow insults and are demonstrating an inability to engage critically with the subject matter in favor of meaningless “gotcha” points which have no teeth. 

Some things to consider, because now I am concerned that you do not have even the base knowledge to discuss this subject efficiently: 

1) are you aware that preschool, pre-k, and kindergarten are all vastly different programs, with the latter requiring at least a bachelors degree to run in the US? Would you not agree that a degree in education counts as training? 
2) are you aware that child abuse and neglect is most likely to happen at the hands of parents/primary caregivers, and that this usually stems from the parent being overwhelmed and unaware of child developmental science? Are you not able to conceptualize that many people have been abused by their mothers - do you deny their experience simply because you believe women are better are caregiving?

Because that's what the unspoken thing in your post is.  If you somehow prove there's inherent differences, then you don't need to respect anyone who steps out of line.  You can enforce some kind of social hierarchy based on how people are born.

Your post makes some flawed assumptions but the biggest one is this: "" I think this argument that sex differences are purely the result of social conditioning is one of the weaker liberal arguments.""

Nobody, but NOBODY, says this, at all, ever.  Everything is always on a scale between extremes.  No human in history is the way they are *solely* because of the gender they were born.  But no human in history is also *only* the result of their gender.  Each person is different, and for each person different things affect different parts of their behavior, or affects them at a different severity, or at different times of their life, or all of those, or some of those.  There is no easy black and white answer for anything.

I can't speak for everyone but the wording choice I take issue with here is ""only."" Certainly social conditioning reinforces and teaches gender roles but there are biological parts of it too. 

> Is the idea that women don't have a natural aptitude with children despite being the sex that carries and gives birth to children and has the ability to feed children with their female organs?

You're close. Because of those biological features. Early childhood education is often seen as an extension of mothering. And because of those biological features, motherly behaviors and instincts are often encouraged as girls age AKA reinforced. 

> Is there a problem with Early Education engaging in systemic discrimination against men? Seems unlikely.

Why does it seem unlikely? There's quite a lot of writings out there talking about the double edged sword men deal with working in ECE either being tokenized or looked at with suspicion of their motivations because it doesn't fit within the traditional box thay society expects men to fit into[^1](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1708/walking-gendered-lines-the-contradictory-expectations-of-men-who-work-in-early-childhood-education)

> Does the Nursing profession systemically discriminate against men too?

Again there's quite a lot of writings, studies, etc also out there discussing the challenges men face in this female dominated industry too ranging from tokenization to being perceived as a sexual threat. 

> Was my 4 year old niece socially conditioned into liking dolls and pretty things, along with most other little girls?... social conditioning doesn't take long at all, and this conditioning is very powerful because girls and boys seem to gravitate to these gendered things, despite only a short time of conditioning.

This is moving more into early childhood development. Some of it is innate and some of it is social conditioning. As a wise man once said. ""A little bit of column A and a little bit of column B""

To summarize I guess. It's not nature OR nurture when it comes to what makes use the way we are but nature AND nurture. A boy might naturally gravitate towards mechanically interesting toys, this interest is also reinforced socially when friends family and parents only buy them toys geared towards traditionally boyish interests.

A few mentioned coding, where most of the pre-computer coding work was done by women until computers could be used as an alternative.
Secretarial work was similar, with secretaries and clerks being a job for educated men until the start of the 20th century. The advent of the typewriter (which meant women could be taught typewriting skills without needing a full college education), and the world wars requiring women to fill in roles previously held by men, changed the role to a predominantly female one.

Nursing was not always so female dominated. Throughout history, nurses were primarily men (often priests). In some cases it would be separated by gender, with female nurses for women. The wars in the 1800s (incl Crimean war and Florence Nightingale) and world wars also played a big role in changing the gender disparity in nursing, to the point where men were prohibited in enrolling as nurses in the army nursing core in the early 1900.

That shouldn't be unusual, but it is. 

I had a thought, why not staff the day care with majority men? Men can certainly look after small children for 8 hours a day, they trust us with critical care patients (if you are licensed for it), we can change a mean diaper, we can comfort a child, and kids generally like us. I had to drop the thought because I realized no one would send their kid to a daycare staffed only by men. We aren't *there* yet. 

Now, on the point about saying social conditioning is a weak argument, it is only weak because people are ignorant. The fact is, controlled properly for biases and repeating them, we find very few cognitive differences between the sexes. in other words, a 'female' brain is just a human brain attached to a female body. Yes, there are different hormones, but that doesn't seem to fundamentally change the way we view the world. We, simultaneously find it very challenging to see out of our culture for anything. Like, look at all of this talk about 'grooming', kids in ancient cultures were around sex and nudity all the damn time. Have you ever been to a classical museum in Europe?

Similarly, the term for the thing you put on in the morning to make you smell good is called a perfume, for men and women. Our culture demands we call it a cologne, even though colognes are also for both men and women. That may seem like a trivial example, but it is part of a much larger ecosystem. You don't think your niece is being socially conditioned because you don't perceive that you are doing that, but how did the dolls end up in her possession? It is almost like there is an entire industry designed to sell toys to girls. Say you manage to raise a girl to 4 without falling into that trap, then they spend a few hours with grandma who promptly buys them a bunch of pink stuff and tells them explicitly this is what girls want/like. You are assuming that these kids are organically separating themselves and their interests, that is a convenient perspective is it not? It absolves us, the adults, of any responsibility in it and we can just say ""see, this is what they *naturally* like and who are we to question it?"" That doesn't mean it is inherently wrong for a girl to like a doll in a pink dress, I am saying it is awfully convenient of us to develop a *just so* explanation while scoffing at the idea this is all essentially manufactured. 

Social conditioning is 24/7/365 situation, it is happening all the time, by all the people, by all the media, you can't get away from it. That isn't an insult, it is just a reality. A lot of us seem to have the thought that we can reason our way out of that, that we aren't truly conditioned, that we are *independent* thinkers. That is just your smart brain doing some ego-protecting behavior. We really aren't, and even the smart among us are socially conditioned.",0.2768704041988685,0.0117438435554504,0.4997103810310364,0.1592140793800354,0,1

I have a family friend who has become a QAnon conspiracy theorist. She recently posted a meme of an open door that something like, ""people who support an open border should celebrate on May 25 by leaving their front door open.""

I commented that nobody on the left supports open borders other than most extreme leftists. She stated that she knows several people on the left that do.

So my question is, do you or someone you know support open borders? I also asked her to name one politician in Congress that is lobbying for open borders. I'm sure she'll ignore that request.

Police and/or prison abolition is a separate issue. Defunding doesn't mean abolition and the people advocating for defunding weren't necessarily advocating for abolition because you can advocate for the former without advocating for the latter. 

But even the abolition position was treated with no nuance just like defunding by people who were either ignorant, bad faith actors or both. Most abolitionists advocate for a gradual approach that in and of itself isn't absolute and a step along the way to some form of abolition is the kind of 'retconned' defunding you mentioned.

I was there, and I reject your shifting the burden to the listener. If there was a messaging issue, it was internal to the protesters, because that is what multiple protestors stated outright.

At that same time, tons of viral twitter and fb posts said things like ""Police originated to chase slaves"" and whether many (like myself) believed in redirecting funding to train mental heath services, these same protesters attacked Biden's statements who wanted to add funding for mental health first responder services but not remove funding from police.

No, not every protester or ally believed ""defund"" meant take away all the funding, including me.

Having Immigration enforcement take ID and perform a background check is a form of control. And likely will require records of entry and departing. Or a VISA. So that is a form of control. Even if the term ""controlled boarder"" is vast. It indicates that it isnt opened or closed (like N. Korea).

We are estimated to have more than ten million people in this country illegally. At no point has congress ever allocated sufficient funding to deport all of them.

Social engineering to keep people from undesirable countries is a part of it, yes, but sustainable numbers are the overall goal.

You are simply delusional. To think that desire to immigrate to the United States has not changed from over a hundred years ago is absolutely absurd. You are disregarding social influences, economic influences, and technological influences that all would factor into increased demand to immigrate. 

>Immigration to the US is fundamentally based on material conditions in the country of origin, not the US.

Yeah, no shit that someone wanting to emigrate from their home country would be dependent upon the material conditions they had. Did you stop to consider the next step in this equation may be to decide where to go? Would they not be comparing nations to determine which nation may grant them the best outcomes which would be independent of the material conditions of their home country? Surely there is a difference between coming to the US compared to going to Canada or Mexico which is right next door including potential accesses to social services, wealth generation for your family, access to modern amenities, and more. 

> Most people don't view us as the ""leaders of the free world"" at this point in time.

YOU may not, but plenty of people do. It is recognized that the United States has more wealth and geopolitical influence then any other country in the western hemisphere. This makes people from other countries very knowledgeable about the United States compared to other nations such as Denmark, Portugal, Singapore, Panama, or Canada despite those countries also being great places to live.

Having low population density for our size doesn't actually mean much since our population tends to revolve around metropolitan areas. We cannot just build communities in the middle of nowhere. Those resources are also not able to be distributed equally in our current system. Things such as social services are already bankrupting our nation despite our current excess in wealth. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security make up around 60% or more of our overall spending and is close to our gross income alone. My premise is based on the fact that resources such as these entitlement programs, electricity, gas, water, and housing are limited and costly. We are able to manage right now because we are keeping our population stable through limited immigration. These resources will be further strained by an increase in population in general and thus my assertion is that open borders will lead to greater numbers of immigrants which will increase our resource burden.

You can advocate for a completely different way of allocating resources in our country, that is fine, but that is not the conversation we have been having.

God I hate this kind of condescending response. If you don't think I addressed the point that point out why. Such low effort. 

>Well, you've given no support for this statement, so why would I just take your word for it?

I would expect the support for the statement to be obvious for anyone who may have studied history, but I guess you didn't. 

The first huge upticks in immigration that we saw was during the 1880s and 90s due to the Industrial Revolution and our need for greater numbers of laborers both to work in the newly developed factories as well as to help build the railroads that crossed the country. As we got into the 20th century, immigration was heavily curtailed in part because of racist ideologies specifically targeting Asia, South America, Africa, and parts of southern Europe along with economic and political ideals of isolationism that we held prior to the world wars. After WWII, the United States became the dominant power of the western hemisphere and slowly began to grow its amount of immigrants over time. This was in part due to our ability to house them thanks to our increased economic standing after the war as well as our change in foreign policy to be more accepting for both moral reasons as well as political in order to combat the spread of communism with the Soviet Union. Many of these immigrants were coming from western Europe as they were our main allies at the time. 

As we get closer to the 1980s and 1990s, we grew our relations with South America in part, again, to combat the spread of communism as well as an effort to increase domestic profits through foreign production thanks to NAFTA and other trade agreements in the 90s. Since then there has been continued increases to immigration as we have continued to source cheap labor from South America in order to keep domestic production high and costs low. People continue to come to the United States with work and education being the two biggest reasons for them to do so. We turn millions of people away every year because we already let in numbers that we are able to handle. In fact, the number one cause of illegal immigration is actually legal visa holders overstaying their work or education visas and remaining in the United States anyway. These numbers would be increased by the millions of people that we would otherwise turn away that already come and this does not include the increase of people who would come if they knew there were no barriers whatsoever. 

That is the historical support for my statements. Feel free to do your own research on the topic as well. 

>The point, that you are ignoring, is that people aren't just waiting in the wings to come to the U.S. if we opened the borders. They come either way, regardless of immigration law. Your angry little questions don't actually address that.

There are, again, millions who are turned away at the border that would otherwise be let in under open borders. I also do not believe your assertion that there aren't people waiting in other countries to emigrate to the United States since there are millions currently waiting for permission to legally come to this country. I guess those people aren't actually waiting? Or do you view them as stupid for just not coming over like other people do to be turned away?

Well, I don't accept your premise that our social spending is unsustainable, and your analysis seems to completely disregard that more people is equal to more tax money, productivity, resources, etc. 

I also don't see any evidence for your belief that these are only currently sustainable through limiting immigration. If anything, we need immigration to make up for the lack of children we are having (another thing you don't acknowledge).

>I am sorry that you don't find utilities and housing as important to consider, but most people do.

You're right, you've been so reasonable. Anyways, I was pointing out that your response didn't reckon with or acknowledge the positive impact immigrants have on our system.

>That is the historical support for my statements. Feel free to do your own research on the topic as well.

All you've done is demonstrated that my position is the correct one. Immigration ebbs and flows over time. You've never supported the argument that immigration would linearly increase if we opened the borders, and your poor, rudimentary reading of history doesn't do that either. 

>There are, again, millions who are turned away at the border that would otherwise be let in under open borders.

Oh no! How will a country of our size ever handle a few million people? 

>Sorry, I shouldn't ask questions you aren't going to answer.

You should try asking good questions, that would be a start. That there are some people who are waiting to come to the US is not evidence that there is an unsustainable number who want to come, or that this number would linearly increase forever. You have taken a simple statement ""some people are waiting to immigrate to the US,"" and extrapolated that to mean what you want it to mean. Hopefully you can put together how foolish that is.

So, to be clear, you *do* think immigrants are resource sinks, on average, at least initially? And we have to control the amount of immigration we allow so that Americans can catch up in making up for the difference.

I have to assume this opinion is at least somewhat colored by our current system where it's illegal for many immigrants to work. Of course *those* immigrants are less likely to bring economic growth.

I'm not sure what point you're making. Mass shootings are a good example that immigration controls are not some sort of failsafe against terrorist attacks (not that you claim them to be, of course). It's a problem that needs to be addressed with good policework regardless of where the terrorists are born.

If they were set on doing that, I really don't think it's ICE that's currently keeping Iran at bay.

No. If you have reason to believe someone is planning a terrorist attack, by all means arrest them. I just don't think the presumption of not being a terrorist and freedom of movement should only befall on people born in the US, for some reason.

The metaphor comparing open borders to opening your house to everybody is the dumb comparison that won't die. I could write a short book on why this metaphor is a bad one, but to sum it up briefly, there's an obvious key difference between a public space and private property. Almost everybody agrees with the principle of open \*state\* borders for citizens... that doesn't mean they agree that every citizen should have access to their private property.

And, as Bryan Caplan pointed out, if you believe that the entire nation is collectively owned, as property, by the citizenry... you are a communist.
