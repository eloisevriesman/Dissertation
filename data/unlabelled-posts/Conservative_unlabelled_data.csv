post_9,post_9_32,"She deserves no respect. Someone who's particularly aggressive with one party's members and policies, and waves by and softballs her preferred party, is just a politically biased, devisive, talk show host. But if you don't appear before the left's popular talk show hosts, they say that you're dodging being critically challenged. They're not remotely critical in the wide scope of politics, and their only aim is to make you look horrible. So like Cruz here demonstrates, you appear on TV with them, knowing what they're after, and ready to make Them look like twits. Mission accomplished.

However, the Democrat viewers of these twit talk show hosts were likely not phased, don't listen to what Cruz is saying, don't consider that he's even remotely making a valid point, because they've already made up their minds (rather the media made it up for them, and they... drank the kool-aid, so to speak) that Cruz, like everyone on the right, is automatically a liar with bad intentions. These shows, no matter what someone on the right says, will twist it to accommodate their own narrative, the approved narrative on the left. On the contrary, (while I'm not a big fan of Cruz, I'll give credit where deserved) Cruz showed up in good faith, argued in good faith, he's presenting truthful arguments, and this host and likely viewers remain.... unmoved. These hosts Only pander to the left. They aren't enlightening them beyond.. the one, strict, leftist viewpoint and propaganda. Even if you're on the left, they'll only allow you to contend that there was foul play if a candidate on the left loses. All wrongs are done on the right, exclusively. That's their position. It's of course ridiculous, but they'll defend it to no end. You cannot suggest there was any foul play on left however. Zero. 

We don't all agree on the right, but that's a feature not a bug. We allow one another the expression of other and competing ideas. Not so on the left. And that's another thing the left have in common with Palestinians, one expression of law to rule them all. The left practice like a totally secular, hedonist version of Sharia Law. Cancel culture is their version of stoning someone to death for defying them. 

The left's talking heads have one objective, make the GOP members look bad, corrupt, and evil to the core. Generate negative sound bites that go viral. They have the brains of a 12 yr old Tik-Tok wannabe 'influencer'.",0.1327459715660311,0.0175790190696716,0.4995004832744598,0.0001044571399688,0,1

Trump was uniquely unqualified to address this issue given his past experience and personality. Before you get mad at me hear me out.

This is the claim. 

From my understanding, Roosevelt initially supported the plan, until public opinion swayed him from it. (Correct me if wrong). Secondly, to claim ""plot by Jews"" would require more than just one dude (Morgenthau) to support the plot. Was there provable widescale support for it by Jews?

Would you call it a Russian plot to take Ukraine or would it require wide spread Russian support for you? Perhaps I generalize to much, but for me if the people planning it, even more so the lead, all share a unique characteristic ,even if it's only a handful of people, I would except it as being a Russian plot. I should clarify I understand and separate participants from the general public. I wouldn't blame all of Judaism over a few.

post_11,post_11_32_4_1_2_1_1_1,"I'd call it ""Russia's plan to take Ukraine"". Or with Iran: ""Iranian foreign policy"". If a Kurd in the Iranian government comes up with a plan, I won't call it a ""Kurdish plan"". That wouldn't make any sense because that assumes ethnic characteristics are playing some great role, as opposed to being about national policy: a plan to be carried out by the country, through the state apparatus. If a Ukrainian in Russia's military comes up with a plan for an offensive, we wouldn't call it ""The Ukrainian offensive operation"".   This confuses and the background of the person is just not relevant. 

If a random American congressman creates a plan to take over the world, it's not representative of anyone else. If this congressman is a Republican, it'd be unfair to call it a ""Republican plot"", unless it had widespread Republican support. Unfair to call it ""America's plan"" if it had no wide backing in America, especially in the government (where power is concentrated). 

If Kamala were to come up with such a plan, would it be ""The African-American plan""? ""Kamala's plan"" would be better, given it'd be her plan.

""Morgenthau Plan"" quite accurately describes whose plan it was ‚Äî his. Had America's government accepted it, it would then become accurate to describe it as ""America's plan for post-war Germany"", given its national acceptance, in that case. 

>Our Christian president at the time stopped a genuine plot by jews to murder 30 million German civilians as retaliation.

This quote makes it sound as if this is a situation of Christians vs Jews, as opposed to Morgenthau vs anyone else. Now, if there was acceptance of this plan by Jews, but not by Christians, then it could be said to be divided upon religious lines. Otherwise, what precisely is the relevance of mentioning the religion of the president? Is it to imply that had Roosevelt been Jewish, he'd have agreed to the plot? It's unclear. 

>Henry Morgenthau Jr. was born into a prominent Jewish family in New York City, the son of Josephine (Sykes) and¬†[Henry Morgenthau Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgenthau_Sr.), a real estate mogul and diplomat. His parents were born in Germany.¬†

In other words, born & raised in America. So should we now say: *Our Christian president at the time stopped a genuine plot by Americans to murder 30 million German civilians as retaliation. ‚Äî* Given that Morgenthau was an American.
