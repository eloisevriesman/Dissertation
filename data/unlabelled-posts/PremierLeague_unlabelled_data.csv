post_3,post_3_35_1,"This is wrong take.. First of all the problem steams from this false narrative that EPL was ever competitive. It was always contested by the same 3-4 clubs going back more then 2 dacedes now. If you want competitive league go watch the Brazilian league or J-League then you will get the definition of competitive league. If you wanna know what the Brazilian league is like as an example it is like Nottingham Forest who just avoided relegation can win the league next season it honestly just shows the Brazilian league is trash and not strong which is the opposite of what you searching for..

But the truth is forcing a fake comeptitiveness goes against sportsmanship and meritocracy itself. Every team plays the beautiful game to win and reach perfection if not nobody would have played the game hence eventually always few teams will reach the level of perfection and ethablish a dynasty and just because Man City has ethablished a dynasty doesn´t mean a mockery of the league it just means one team reached perfection meaning they reached their goal.

If you looking for fake competitiveness you shouldn´t watch the great game because what you are saying in directly is someone should throw the games.

If nobody is allowed to excel then what is the point of playing football at all is the question that needs to be asked?

Yes, because that makes all the sense in the world. As we all know the big companies just love hiring incompetent fucks while the most qualified candidates all famously take on mininum wage jobs. Thats how the world works

And yes the best managers in history have proven themselves by taken the underperforming and lower ranked and pushing them to heights not seen before. Klopp is a good example of that, came to an underperforming team, bought well (not the best on the market) but players he felt would gel in his system and won trophies. And albeit on 1 PL title (one which you guy refuse to recognise because it was the Covid year) but they will build a statue of him out front if Anfield. That shows the stature of a man and a manager.

He can argue he was sacked all he likes but if they prove tapping up and their looks to be a case he’s fk’d as is anyone associated. 

Premier league rules dictate that all directors, personnel and clubs should act in a good faith manner to one all, they should not do things behind others backs that may harm another party. 

They have breached Omar’s contractual obligations at City as he’s not due to finish his gardening leave until later this year, emails he sent in February from an Ineos address show he was most definitely working for them without permission.

If they were also disclosing private information between each other (which it sounds to be) and such info may even have been subject under a non disclosure agreement, then they land themselves in trouble with parties on either side of that contract.

post_4,post_4_20_1_2_1,"It’s not about legal/ illegal it’s about the terms of the contract with an employer. 

A contract can stipulate not to speak to other employers without permission, and operate in confidentiality. 

If this is taken to court, a judge will take into account the seniority and high profile nature. 

And there would be a separate lawsuit to establish to what extent Man Utd had used that breach of confidentiality to their own gain as knowingly using this is a breach of the conditions of how to act as a company. 

And then separate to that there is premier league rules, which may or may not be applicable here. 

This all might be a small matter, it may have been an innocent mistake by Ashworth and Man Utd. There might not have been detailed leaking of operational information of Newcastle United. But an investigation is warranted.

It is understood that Dan Ashworth divulged confidential information in regards to the mechanism of his appointment from Brighton, in order to expedite and favour his appointment at Man Utd. 

When Ashworth was hired from his role at Brighton to work for Newcastle, he was placed on gardening leave and Newcastle paid compensation to remove his contractual obligations. Man Utd now wish to appoint Ashworth and Newcastle are seeking similar terms of gardening leave and suitable compensation persuant to his experience gained whilst working for Newcastle. There is nothing unfair, unethical or illegal about this. It is how people in senior positions in high profile companies move across. 

During gardening leave, an employer entitled to apply a restrictive covenant on a former employee to prevent them from having contact with customers or working for a competitor. 

If the discussions held between Ashworth and Berrada constitute ‘work’ then he could be in a serious situation.

post_10,post_10_60,"I’m going to offer a slightly different opinion and keen to hear if other people have similar experiences or anecdotes. A buddy of mine is a professional poker player, and by proxy, got involved in a lot of rather shady sports betting run by organized crime. 

Some of the names involved (hearsay from buddy) are rather high profile in English football - I suspect if folk Googled the intersection of sports betting and English football (not footballers, but very high profile folk in the actual football business), you’d get a pretty good idea of who might be involved. But I’d rather not name names given the public nature of this forum. 

From what I’ve heard, the betting rings involved could influence results of games, typically in lesser known leagues, but I’ve heard anecdotes within top European leagues such as Serie A, though not explicitly in the EPL. Now when it comes to organized crime and the sums of money involved, sure there could be carrots to get footballers to influence a result, but there’s also the stick. I wonder how many players might be coerced into some of these, rather than simply fall into this out of stupid greed. I don’t think it applies to Paqueta given the details of the case, but it’s worth a thought.

post_10,post_10_67,"I'm Brazilian. Followed him at Flamengo when he started.

Until Lyon, he was jot that player.

One could argue that French league is physically too intense compared to Brazil. We do have this as a debate because of how things went for Neymar.

You could argue Neymar was diving, but from BR perspective, he was constantly receiving a foul. So, French league, FOR US, does a lot of fouls that the referee doesn't do. 

Paqueta went there to play in a mid team, got too ""hardcore,"" right?

Absolutely not. 

When he arrived at Orem, Me and other friends commented how he was constantly being booked for stupid fouls. Most of them made no sense. Not like in Lyon. He doesn't do just tactical fouls, he does stupid, nonsense, too violent fouls out of nowhere.

Long ago we started commenting on betting for him being booked. It's no surprise he is involved with that. I've watched a lot of his games. He is far away from the player he was in Flamengo from a foul perspective. To me, he is absolutely involved with betting schemes.

I ask for a WH fan here, do you think the fouls he does in the games are ""normal""? I don't think so. Too bad for him bc he is a very good player that could go higher (with all respect for WH).",0.1362334083595462,0.0472428202629089,0.4997147023677826,5.608797073364258e-05,0,1

post_12,post_12_11_1_2_1,"I think a little context is needed here. Everton as a club is a shambles. It’s been in freefall since Ancelotti left and Moshiri (and whoever might be backing him) decided they wanted out. It was circling the drain in the two previous seasons, avoiding relegation on the second last match and last match respectively. He spent nothing in the summer, had to sell players such as Gordon to offset PSR. He had to manage through 2 points deductions. Dealing with one of these issues would be trying but dealing with all of them at the same time, still securing a 33% improvement in points won and achieving safety before the final rounds of matches is an achievement(all things being equal). It might be hard for non-Everton fans to understand but I feel that those fans who have lived the season will appreciate this.

Edit: he also shored up the defence. Only City, Arse and those lovable reds had a better defence this season. Pickford pushed Raya for the golden gloves. He brought on the likes of Branthwaite and has improved Mykolenko and Tarkowski.

post_12,post_12_48_1_1_1,"Ancelotti had better attacking options in James Ridriguez, Sigurdsson, Richarlison and Bernard. Also, had an attacking LB in Lucas Digne and a younger Coleman to push on. They helped Lewin to score the goals he did. Even then, he missed plenty of chances. 20 goals a season is punching above his weight. He’s a 12-15 goal man at most.

Dyche had none of those attacking options and also had to rely on 38 year old Ashley Young and a defensive LB (Mykolenko) - they are hardly going to cut teams open. However, he found a system that those players could play effectively.

As for inaccurate figures, it’s hard to claim someone is better if they finish alongside or, in Frank’s case, way below. The table rarely lies. As for “playing better” football, what is that? All those teams (including Emery’s Villa) shipped more goals than Everton. Is good defending not part of “better football”? Or do you only consider tippy tappy, pass for the sake of it with little end product as “better football”? Does the PL award points for artistic merit now?

You are right about one thing though. We do have some good players. Most of them are defensive minded though - explains the tight defensive record. We lack pace and creativity in midfield and upfront. As I mentioned those type of players were sold in order to try (unsuccessfully, as it panned out) to meet PSR rules and also because the owner wants out. As for standards and principles, you can afford to have those when you’re not on the brink of financial oblivion thanks to 30 years of low ambition and incompetent administrators. The main aim for the club is to try to survive long enough to get into the new stadium and hopefully secure new owners who can instil some form of modern, professional approach to running a football club. Unfortunately, that is the current reality, as sad as it sounds for a club of the size and history which Everton has. To suggest anything else is delusional.",0.0404697908655178,0.016621708869934,0.4997647404670715,0.0006919503211975,0,0
post_12,post_12_48_1_1_1_1,"Ancelotti had James because he signed him. He came (for free or on loan iirc) because of Ancelotti. Dyche signed Young. 

Better managers tend to attract better players. And vice versa. 

Bernard? Lol. Come on. He also had Michael Keane and Fabian Delph.

Frank performed better because he has worse players and has spent hardly any money the last 3 years, since promotion. He lost Raya in the Summer and had Toney suspended most of the season— that’s the two most important positions in the team. Where would you be if you lost Pickford and DCL?

And Frank shows more tactical variety and innovation. Good football is attacking football and, yes, “tippy tappy” football, ie passing and possession.

Fans reward artistic merit. That’s why big clubs and top clubs are rarely interested in the likes of Dyche or Moyes or Fat Sam. It’s why Bayern want Kompany and not Dyche.

Dyche signed players to suit the way he plays. Workmanlike. There’s nothing wrong with that. But let’s not pretend he didn’t have options. I’m a Leeds fan and basically our whole squad was available for loan in the Summer. Dyche chose to take Harrison, who was a good fit (although he’s played him out of position all season). But he could have gone for Sinisterra, who has a lot more ability.

I don’t really buy the “you have to play rubbish football to get results” shtick. Also, playing good football tends to create better assets to sell, as it makes players look better and top clubs gravitate towards teams who play good football when scouting transfer targets. Look at Brighton. Look at how good Bielsa made Kalvin Phillips look, etc.

post_12,post_12_48_1_1_1_1_1,"Some responses to your points.

>Ancelotti had James because he signed him. He came (for free or on loan iirc) because of Ancelotti. Dyche signed Young. 

Everton had money to afford James's fee and wages. Since the Ukraine war, they are skint (I'll leave it to others to speculate on the link between the two events). Last summer's transfer dealings relied on loans, frees and ""zero down pay the rest on the never never"". Lack of money affects who you can sign, especially in the premier league.

>Frank performed better because he has worse players 

Most Evertonians would happily swap Mbeumo, Wissa and Toney for Doucoure, Lewin and McNeil. Brentford have other decent professionals in Cristian Norgaard and Rico Henry too. Granted their central defence and keeper aren't up to much but you make them out to be at Luton's level. That squad finished 9th last season.

>And Frank shows more tactical variety and innovation. Good football is attacking football and, yes, “tippy tappy” football, ie passing and possession.

Dyche cut his cloth according to the squad's strength this year. That was basically stay in shape, let the other team have the ball, wait for them to make a mistake and try to profit from it. I would be disappointed if he played that way with the Man City squad but unfortunately Jimmy Garner is not Rodri, Doucoure is not Foden and McNeil is not Silva.

>Dyche signed players to suit the way he plays. Workmanlike. There’s nothing wrong with that. But let’s not pretend he didn’t have options. 

Any options he may have had were extremely limited by the fact, and I am not sure if I mentioned this already, THE CLUB IS SKINT.

>I don’t really buy the “you have to play rubbish football to get results” shtick.

Real Madrid played what you call ""rubbish football"" to beat Man City and get to the CL final. They put 10 behind the ball, gave possession to City and said ""do something"". City couldn't, Madrid are in the final and I guarantee not one of their fans gives two shiny shites.

>Also, playing good football tends to create better assets to sell...

The sad reality is that Branthwaite is likely to be sold. Happily, he is likely to fetch a big fee. The same would go for the likes of Pickford and Onana. By your logic, Dyche has contributed to growing the value of these assets.

>Anyway, you’re lucky it was a very weak season at the bottom. Next year should be more fun.

Don't you mean that Forest were lucky it was a very weak season? After all, they finished below Everton as did your dad, Frank, and can be thankful that the bottom three were so weak. Anyway, it's going to be another challenging close season because of the ownership situation.

You wouldn’t swap DCL for Toney this season, because Toney has been suspended most of the season. And Frank developed all these players, he’s been at Brentford years and got them promoted, which means he gets credit for, well, everything.

There are at least 4 other positions that require prioritising before Bruno. This idea that you keep repeating about building a team around 1 guy won’t work when there’s equally no quality around him.

Again, I put it to you to recommend who you would have as Bruno’s replacement that would match his quality with the funds generated from his sale - from your own predicted sale of 36 million.

I respect your opinion but in all honesty I take it with a pinch of salt in comparison to the United fans that watch him play week in week out.

Edit - I’ve just seen your bottom statement about being locked into a 4231 with Bruno. This is completely false. Even in the last game of the season we played 4222 which was utilised with solksjaer. He has played 433 for both United and Portugal. He has probably played the most positions for United out of all current squad players.

post_14,post_14_7_1_4_1_1_1_1_1,"4222 because United isn’t progressing but going backwards…. It’s not that complicated that he was doing a shift in positions/play style while dropping a ton of points down the stretch that allowed Newcastle and Chelsea to pass into Europe.  He was shaking the tree to find a result.  It’s simple, with all the years Bruno has been at United, they’ve never been close to winning the league.  4222 because you’re not scoring goals and not getting any production from the wide players.  Antony has less goals the Pepe’s first season at Arsenal, this after 2 with United.  Where’s Pepe now… turkey last I checked

The fact there people who literally feel this highly about a guy who is not going to be a legend shows partly why United are where they are.  Sell him now, by some younger players to build a base.

Sell him 40m and buy 2 guys that will 50m total.

It’s not like United need 1 guy… they need starters at RW, LW, ST, CM, RB, RCB at a minimum.  I question whether Shaw is good enough, and Martinez….

To be honest at this point you’re beginning to sound identical to Souness re Pogba, blaming all of United’s woes on one man.

I am not sure there’s any point continuing this discussion really. The general consensus amongst us match going fans is that Bruno is paramount to the team. Your contrarian opinion is not only controversial even by rival standards, but is of no importance to the team. If we keep Bruno and we remain shit, then it’s a win for you no?

Edit - I’ve just seen your edit now where you admit the issue with United has been the flanks and the requirement to replace multiple roles. Can you not see the juxtaposition in comparison of your original stance that Bruno is the problem? It feels like you’re agreeing with me in everything except your conclusion…

post_14,post_14_7_1_4_1_1_1_1_1_1_1,"No I answered your question, sorry that I need to explain why you’re not trying to replace him with a 36m player, it’s because the 10 is dead and unless you have 2 hybrid 8s in a midfield 3, you’re going to get overwhelmed.  You could be able to get it to work, if you had a double DM where their job is more to clean up second balls outside the box and win possession back immediately. That again limits you mostly to counter attacking and reduces your creativity centrally.   But you’re not trying to find a 10…. 10s are mostly done on the league.  You can do it in a 3421 but not in any type of 3 man midfield.  And the reason you can’t is because you get overwhelmed in the midfield

I would look at Lucas Paqueta, Reider, Fabbian, Rohl… these are guys I would look to add balance to the midfield and not rely on one guy who clearly can’t do it.  You can say it’s a downgrade from Bruno, and they currently are but the point isn’t about keeping Bruno….  In 4 years, if United buy 1 of every position and nail it correctly, in 4 years bruno is 33 and at best a role player. Who’s been phased out as a primary 10 to a CM on Wed to play brentford.  Sure that could work, it’s better to cut and run and rebuild.  Same goes with Rashford.

You clearly don’t understand.  Say 10 is winning the league. You can have Bruno who is a 9 but because of the his limitations and tactics it forces you to have a bunch of 6/7s around him playing through him.  This isn’t Ted Lasso….

post_14,post_14_18,"Man the comments here. I am a Spurs fan and our best run in recent history was under Poch. I watched a fair bit of Chelsea this season too. He is so massively often disrespected, ironically, a bit like Harry Kane. 

Under Poch, your team doesn't sit back, it goes toe to toe with the best and competes. Be it City, be it Real Madrid or Barcelona. He is not obsessed with possession but still plays attacking football. Creates so many chances. Under him Spurs had one of the best defenses in the league and he built and grew that young team from the ground up. 

Anyone who has watched Chelsea knows they competed with the likes of City, Liverpool, beat Spurs and general play was good. He didn't have a striker and so many injuries. Two cup runs and 3 points of Spurs (who got massive accolades). 

Personally I am happy that things ended with Chelsea for him. But I always believe he deserves to be top. A Bayern job would be great for him. A knack of improving players, getting the best out of them, reaching finals, going extremely close (yes, falling at the last hurdle but watch those who follow not even get close).",0.0290644345645859,0.0198796391487121,0.4991249740123749,0.9997611045837402,0,1

You’re right though, we played best against teams like City/Liverpool to some extent, we scored a ton of goals as well. However we also leaked a LOT of goals, often in a similar fashion, which showed a certain weakness in his coaching.

Hodgson has had an extensive career around the globe and his tenure at Fulham was directly after Wally with the Brolley who took them to a European final, so relatively he didn't succeed but it isn't as if he floundered.


Brendan Rodgers...Yea, he's essentially a Scottish Pochettino. He won the SPL with Celtic when they had no competition.

United vs City is just about locality. We've only been comparable quality-wise for 3 or 4 seasons since World War 2.

They would never have gone into liquidation. If they had gone into administration someone would have purchased them before it got to the liquidation stage.

The club itself wasn't losing that much money. The owners couldn't afford to pay the loan they had taken out to buy the club themselves and RBS were calling it in. The club could have made £200m profit, but the owners still would not have been able to pay the loan, as they owed more than that. The club was used as collateral against the debt, and that's how RBS forced a sale.

post_18,post_18_0,"In my opinion, I believe that they're going to basically have nothing happen to them, but that's actually what I want, for the sole reason that I want FFP scrapped.

At this point, a lot of people have the opinion that FFP was never to actually try and stop Portsmouth and Leeds from happening again, it was to prevent the likes of people like Roman and Sheikh Mansour from buying clubs and then using their money to compete with the already established clubs.

This is accented by the fact that the history of the sport for the most part is defined by teams who spent the most money winning the trophies, and the teams let the already corrupt UEFA put in a rule for the sole purpose of stifling the competition. ""Organic"" growth is almost impossible because every time a smaller club has a good season, bigger clubs poach their best players and those smaller clubs have to get recruitment perfect, or else they end up like Southampton and get relegated once the well of top academy talent dries up.

If you really wanted to prevent Portsmouth, Leeds, Rangers, etc from happening again, a much better way of doing things would be to make the owners put up the money on the spot. For example, if there is a player whose total transfer fee is 50 million GBP and their wages over the course of the contract after accounting for all incentives and bonuses comes out to be 30 million, the owner/club would have to put down 80 million in a bank account on the spot to prove they have the money for said player, and then at the end of the contract or when they sell the player, they'd get back the unspent wages or otherwise be able to use the transfer fee received for that player to prove they had that money. What this does is prevent owners from being awful by putting a ton of debt onto the club, while allowing for owners to do what they always did before 2010 and dump their own money in if necessary.

This is just my two cents on the matter because in general I think the rules shouldn't exist as they exist now as all it does is stifle clubs like Villa from having their owners spend a bunch of money to invest because they have to go off of the revenue the club made instead of being able to put their outside money in.",0.0404565390852217,0.0201412439346313,0.499750554561615,0.0152681171894073,0,1
post_18,post_18_0_1,"All this does is effectively further entrench Man City and Chelsea or similar clubs because most actual business have to project out future revenue and cash flow before making for example equipment purchases that will be used over future years.  Arsenal is a great example, we got the short end of the stick with rise of Abramovich and Sheik Mansour.  We had Highbury 38,000 seat stadium, but to compete with Old Trafford in the 00’s we built a new stadium.  We had to pay off the debt of the stadium so we had to be very careful about spending.  Abramovich with his stolen Russian billions did not.  With your rule only he and maybe Man United at the time could have bought expensive players.  Same when Sheik Mansour came along to lift Man City within 3 years from firmly mid-table at best team to title winners.  All business run on debt and loans while projects are going on before the revenue is collected.  My small consulting firm does.  I see no reason why soccer clubs should not be able to do that.  The problem is when the spending is not tethered to the reality of revenues.  Chelsea first and then Man City mastered this.  Chelsea through straight up owners “loans” and Man City through their £400 million related entity Etihad Airways sponsorship deal that was larger than Arsenals and Liverpools based on my recollection despite Man City not being a fair comparison in terms of on field success at the time.  Now Chelsea is using 7 year contracts, now banned, and selling its training ground to “itself” to create paper cash flow.  City is using Girona FC to stash upcoming prospects.  

What we need is common sense rules, like one club cannot own another, having independent evaluation of all sponsorship deals, etc.  stuff like that",0.0282441030508268,0.026645004749298,0.4997468590736389,0.0201959609985351,0,1

Boehly comes out the other week seemingly happy with the progress being made and saying he can see the plan is coming together when he watches how they play. He also takes Poch to dinner last week ahead of this meeting. No mention of Eghbali.

Then this meeting happens. Eghbali turns up, apparently with a load of crap data about big chances missed and things which the manager cant actually be responsible for. Questioning the injury record under Poch when Chelsea have had the worst injury record in the PL for several seasons. Also, when Poch was at Spurs his methods were praised as being the reason Spurs players had significantly less soft tissue injuries. Maybe, just maybe it takes time for players bodies to adapt to new training regimens and these injuries were more just a continuation of injuries from the several seasons this injury situation has been going on. 

It seems clear that Boehly is a scapegoat and its really scrambled egg brained Eggbali pulling the trigger on this stuff.

He has a rep for developing youth, and being objective, I'd say we could see some leaps from a few players. That stuff was a net-positive.

I don't know about that. It sounds like he expected to be part of the summer window and he was locked out, and then was disappointed with the haul. He didn't like their plans with Maatsen, he didn't like having a short squad. And then after the Wolves match, the board let him know they weren't happy with things, and from that point on, it was the board demanding/asking/suggesting that he do X or Y and him refusing.

post_22,post_22_13,"This is a very interesting discussion to be had considering the recent report - outlined in the article. For me, it's all well and good to have sporting directors to plan and carry the long term vision of the club. I also think it's okay for them to have a major influence on recruitment decisions. But there needs to be a balance on where their authority stops.

For me it is that once they identify a suitable manager that they think is appropriate, they should allow the manager the freedom to make their decisions. However, Chelsea is moving into a system that involves the sporting directors so much even in the day to day activities of the manager including training and tactics.

Which I personally think is absolutely ridiculous. Because at that point, the manager isn't really given any space to think or challenge the norm set out by the hierarchy. And he is forced to produce results in that system which might not even be the right way.

And in the end, who takes the blame? The manager.

I don't think the owners are right for enforcing such a sporting director-centric approach where they get to even dictate decisions that the manager should take.

They're going to create an environment that top coaches will not enjoy - thereby dissuading them from joining Chelsea. Anyway, it doesn't look like Chelsea want an 'elite' coach as they are looking for someone 'progressive'.

That's what I think at least. Let me know what you all think.",0.0252088622596894,0.1266471147537231,0.4997622370719909,0.0009364187717437,0,0
post_22,post_22_13_1,"Finally an article that actually tried to discuss the real issue, which is the more “progressive” organisational structure that the ownership is trying to implement. 

What they are trying to introduce is a structure that is more compartmentalised and collaborative across departments and levels (main team to youth setup). What this means is that various personnel will come together on a wide variety of issues to give their input, but ultimately the responsibility for the final say will fall to the relevant “compartment”. 

For example, when discussing squad building, the football directors, manager, recruitment team, managers of different youth levels, etc will come together to discuss the state of the current team, and plan transfers and departures. The beauty of it is that this collaborative approach does not just emphasise the needs the first team, but considers it from the perspective of the entire organisation. It might perhaps seek to fill a positional gap in the youth teams, or perhaps discuss the tactics of the youth setup to align with the first team, etc. Basically, ownership is trying to build a baseball organisation in football. Football might be becoming more compartmentalised with positions like director of football becoming more common, but it’s still a far cry from the way baseball orgs are run, where you have pitching and bullpen coaches, hitting coaches, base coaches. Compare that to how Poch was pushing back on the idea if a set-piece coach.

So this is the vision that ownership had for Chelsea. In this structure, the role of manager is afforded a lot less control than traditionally given to a manager, but are expected to be involved in a greater operational breadth and provide input. As you might expect, this more “progressive” job scope might not be acceptable to many managers in the industry. That’s likely why Chelsea are looking to hire young managers - 1. For longevity, 2. Likely greater willingness to adapt to the club system compared to veteran managers.

Unlike the various speculations that people put forth to explain the departure of Tuchel and Poch, I strongly believe that the true reason is simply a misalignment of philosophy regarding how the organisation is run, which is exactly the reason given by the club, but for some reason doubted and ignored by fans. Tuchel was likely not willing to involve himself in the operations of the organisation, only willing to take on the responsibilities of a first team coach and only any tasks relevant to that role. And I don’t know which aspect of the team structure Poch is against, but my guess would be the way Chelsea wants to compartmentalise, especially with recruitment and coaching, seeing how he did not want a set-piece coach to begin with. Questions might be asked as to why Chelsea hired Poch to begin with if this misalignment exists. It is a fair question, and I am not going to pretend I know the answer. It could be that we needed a manager and Poch was the best available at the time, and now that better candidates we like are available, we mutually part ways to pursue those candidates. Or perhaps Poch did not fully understand what working in the organisation’s structure entailed until he was actually here. Hard to tell.

Now there are various critiques that can be levelled on Chelsea. On a more macro level, there are huge question marks over whether the baseball system is fully transferrable, especially when it comes to recruitment. Baseball recruitment is very organisation-centric, but there just aren’t that many player moulds in baseball, and while the tactics and strategy are deceptively nuanced to the unfamiliar, it’s not the same as in football where the lack of certain types of player could break a particular style. So there is an argument here that in terms of recruitment, you might want it to be a little more manager-centric. Remember that in this structure, the manager is involved in the recruitment discussion, but does not have the final say. I would also criticise the failure to bring in a couple of experienced players this season the ease the transition into a young squad. I fully understand the transfer policy of the team and do think it’s a good idea. After all, players tend to mature by their mid 20s, so you buy up these talents in their early 20s that will mature to become the core of the team in 2 years time (think Enzo, Caicedo, Jackson, Palmer), then you buy up these 16-18 year olds to form the next generation (think Paez, Estevao). However the team could have used a few veterans to guide the team through this phase.

Ultimately, i do agree with the direction of the tram and the structure being set up. I think a more collaborative and compartmentalised structure like in baseball is going to be more effective in the long run for the continued success of the club, but it is essential that this structure is being sufficiently adapted to the football context.",0.0248677338117841,0.019798457622528,0.4997655153274536,0.0087871551513671,0,1

post_22,post_22_20_1_1,"OK Read it on my laptop - I found the article a bit vague and at the same time hyperbolic.

Like 2 of the 3 pages seem to be reacting to a tweet  ""Mauricio Pochettino’s successor will have to accept the authority of the board and sporting directors, with a control that could even stretch into elements of on-pitch coaching"" 

To me - this is the way the game is moving - marginal gains from specialists - the Athletic did a piece with the substitution specialist - was an awesome listen.  

The guy approached a problem, and thought maybe there's another way than what has always been done... I'm all for that. Here's a youtube video of the same guy being interviewed. I think most top clubs are adopting his ""finisher"" methodology [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysEbioz4qnw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysEbioz4qnw)

  
I view our set piece specialist in a similar vein. I doubt the set piece guy will be dictating exactly what corner routine is run when. It also sounds like he will also have some involvement with Cobham - I think that's smart too - make our amazing academy products better at set pieces.  

  
In a way it was similar under Roman, if a Manager with a lot of control wanted to play a certain way, and we did not win - they gone pretty fast.  Roman had his guys that he fell in love with - strikers mostly, and Managers were kind of stuck playing Shevchenko and Torres...  

Emanalo assembled the dream young team, and we all lament in hindsight that they gave into Mourinho power and shifted out KDB and Salah. Marina was always buying for the loan Army (remember the 2017 transfer window!), plenty of our Managers were stuck with Frankenstein squads... just another example of the authority of boards of the past.

post_24,post_24_9,"I dont care about FFP or PSR personally. I find both rule sets to be inherently unfair. Eg. High revenue clubs in the big six can spend 4 times on payroll what Bournemouth spend.

I would support either

1. true equality in terms of spending via a salary cap.
2. a free market where an owner can invest what they want.

I have never understood the arbitrary arguments in favor of either FFP or PSR. In real life the most common way to grow a business entity is for owners to provide large amounts of cash in the form of equity investments. Eg. IPO offerings on the NYSE.

Owners investing cash into a business is the most common way to grow.

I think Man City broke the rules. I just think they are arbitrary and unfair rules implemented in 2011/12 season.

Everything man City is accused of doing was perfectly legal prior to the 2011/12 season. I think they cheated. I just dont care about this type of cheating.

If they were accused of bribing referees or paying opposing players to throw matches (match fixing) or some other type of cheating other than paying their own employees too much in compensation, I would care a lot.

It wouldnt have mattered if FFP or similar had arrived in 2008, 2003, 1992, 1981, 1946, 1920, 1888. If there ever came an owner that was willing to break and bend the regulations. Although I do recall reading it somewhere regulation on Ownership in Engish football upto 1980s were actually pretty strict but during the 1980s they started lose up the regulations then came 1992 rebranding of English topflight followed by some external changes such as Bosman and UEFAs rebranding European Cup to Champions League and aboltion of Cup Winners Cup. So top-level football had created a perfect grounds for rough owners to arrive. and that of curse happened with the arrival of Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003, and it has only gotten worse since then,   So I would argue that the 115 charges of man city are just consquences of football authorties daft decisons in 1980s and 1990s to create perfect condition for rough owners to take control of the game.

Every league winner for many years has had few injuries. City the past few years. Liverpool when they won, only had some injuries on Van Dijks CB-partner. Infact the core of that team played close to 90% of all matches in their prime.
Chelsea and Leicester, barely any injuries and we can name their starting eleven.
Liverpool in 13/14 had like 12 players that could play football. Had no injuries and therefore could compete.

Injury prone players take up space in a squad, and especially if they are really good players they become a problem. A club cant really count on them and they then need extra players that can step in. More salary used, and more players in the squad meaning a talented youth that could be number 20 in the squad has to be number 25 because the club needs better back up.

It matters due to the effect that globalisation has had on the local football culture that has built said clubs and the league system.

The only fans I see online who are in favour of proposals such as the ESL and playing competitive domestic games abroad (which represents the erosion of footballing culture into a purely capitalist product) are foreign fans. Their argument is ""well, I'm just as *much* of a fan as the people  who go every week! My voice matters just as much as theirs!""

No, you're not. You aren't the ones who built those clubs. You aren't the ones who keep the soul of the club alive. You aren't the ones who create the atmosphere. You aren't the ones whose lives are embedded in the club and its local community. You aren't the ones who have supported the club, often through thick and thin, for their whole life.

What heinous people would call ""legacy fans"" are the ones who have given the most to their respective club, and stand to lose the most.

*That's* why I believe that there is a distinction between ""levels"" of support.

It will just lead to soulless games played out in front of tourists with no atmosphere and everyone will be wondering ""how did football get so lifeless?""

We're already in the process of this, because in greedy people's minds, the tourists who show up to a game of a club they've only been following for a few years is ""just as much of a fan"" as the local who has been going for 20+ years who has now been priced out. All because that tourist will spend more money.

>While sometimes discrediting foreign fans looks like borderline racism....

Wheeey first one to call it racism 😂

>People give their time and money abroad as well to watch their teams cant imagine how much it costs to have merch and subscriptions needed to stay connected....some people stay awake all night to watch a match....

Good for them, they however imo should not have just as big of a say on the management of the club or league as """"""legacy fans"""""", the ones who have been supporting the club for decades, the ones who provide the atmosphere at games and the ones who actually helped to create the culture that capitalists have turned into an extremely profitable product.

There's only one reason why higher ups at clubs want there to be no distinction, because all they give a shit about is making more money. Is that what football should be about?

Errm Newcastle were very much financially stable before the takeover, it's the one thing you can give Ashley credit for.

Globalisation is inevitable. It shouldn't however come at the cost of English football's soul, identity and culture. The argument that ""X fan from the USA who has been watching for a few years is just as much of a fan as anyone!"" is the non-financially based justification for that erosion.

This year it was his tactics. We didn't have a functional attack for 6 months. People were praising ""big 3 points and shutting teams out"" when I was watching 70 minutes of the horseshoe of death and nervy finishes. He played Havertz LCM for 6 months which could theoretically work but not with way Arsenal play.

He also played Nketiah up top for 3 months and while I admire the trust, Nketiah is useless against low blocks needing lots of space to perform and doesn't track back. Then there's loads of individual mistakes but I'll only mention this one that really annoyed me. After weeks of freescoring with Havertz up top and him seeing a big resurgence we chose to play Jesus up top against Villa away in a big game that would decide the title.

Yes, I am telling you that you are not as big a fan as someone who has been going to games for 20+ years and whose family are all fans as well. That person has contributed so much more to the club than you.

There's been plenty of discourse around how real fans are being driven out by ticket prices and are being replaced by tourists who are casual fans who don't contribute to the atmosphere, are you going to say ""there's no problem, those tourists are just as big fans as the fans who have been going for 20+ years who were driven out""?

>And they don't contribute to the atmosphere at the games for my benefit.. Thats stupid too... They do it to show their love for the team.

Yes, that's true. And they're also a big part of the reason why you watch at home on TV.

>Just as much as I do at home.

Oh yea, it's TOTALLY the same 😂

>. U seem privileged.. Not understanding that people can be massive fans even if they cannot afford to attend games or buy merch..

It's telling that you don't include location in your arguments. I would absolutely accept the argument from a Scouser who lives locally and has supported Liverpool/Everton their whole lives, have gone to loads of games but can no longer afford it. That person *is* a big fan who has unfortunately been driven out by the worst of capitalist tendencies (i.e. the intentional move to suck money out of tourist fans at the extent of local fans)

I will not accept that argument from someone who doesn't live in the same country (yet alone the same city), has gone to zero games, has only supported the club for a few years and screams rabidly about how they're ""JUST AS MUCH OF A FAN"" as a local whose whole life has been embedded in the club.

You. Are. Not. The. Same. And that's OK. You can still be a fan, just don't have delusions.

I'm not as big a Newcastle fan as a local Geordie who has gone to every home game for 20+ years. It would be incredibly tone deaf for me to suggest that. And I'm completely fine with it, they're the ones who keep the soul of the club alive.

>Try passion matters.. Doesn't matter where it is shown.

It absolutely matters. You are not ""showing the same passion"" as someone who has been going to games for 20+ years, or has supported the club their whole life and their whole family is centered around the club.

>You are not a true fan.

When they fired Tuchel, they had already bought established star players like Sterling, Koulibaly, and Cucurella to add experience to the team. However, things didn’t go as planned, and these players failed to elevate the team. Realizing their mistake with these experienced players, they opted for a coach who had succeeded in building a smaller team with limited resources.

They then hesitated to wait and were possibly influenced by the fans' impatience with Potter. So, they decided to hire someone the fans liked, thinking that if he succeeded, great; if not, they would go for a more experienced coach.

Bournemouth gave City more of a game than Arsenal without being anywhere nearly as good.

Cycling is ultimately about fuelling a guy to go as fast and long as possible on a bike.

Financial doping in football gets you players, coaches, facilities and everything else but you still have to bring it all together, and high performance is guarantee. Look at Chelsea, PSG, even the Galactico period at Real Madrid. Manchester City would never have had the chance to have the materials to work with had Abu Dhabi not juiced their finances but to actually produce what they have using that backing is pretty extraordinary. You can argue that Armstrong being the fastest doper was extraordinary too though I guess but I still think the many many more things to get right in football make it a less than perfect comparison.

Sorry but this just seems like typical ""every team plays their absolute best against US whilst playing like shit against THEM!"" bollocks you hear from a lot of clubs throughout the years.

Teams will always have tactical considerations dependent on the opponent. City's main ""weakness"" is vulnerability on the counter (weakness is a generous term). So teams will inevitably try to exploit that.

post_24,post_24_60_1_1_1,">I mean you’re proving my point, Newcastle is a side that’s actually trying to get in the Top 4, getting a point off City is a good point home or away, hence why you were playing your socks off last season. 

I mean if a ""positive result"" is 1 point from 6, sure. I wouldn't say it is in the grand scheme of things, even if it's often the best you could wish for against City (because they're just *that* good)


>I actually watched the Spurs game last week and credit to them they actually played really well regardless of their poor form on the run up

And yet they still lost... I'm just saying the instances where teams played their ""best"" football against City and won are incredibly rare, and it would be impossible to attribute that all to ""everyone else just didn't try to get a positive result"".

People said the exact same thing about Fergie's United.

>I’m just saying whenever I watch City play a mid table side away I’m never convinced performance wise the opposition is playing their best ball. Again with all due respect I attest this to a psychological fear more than anything.

There's a psychological element that affects lower league teams playing against any of the big boys. Sorry but I think it would be naive to say that City are the only ones it happens to.

Against City it's most often just a lose lose.

Play your ""best"", most fluid football and lose (which is statistically the most likely outcome)?

""They were so naive, you can't play like that against City and not expect to get punished.""

Play a low block and try to hit them on the counter (which is a direct attempt to exploit their one semi-weakness)?

post_24,post_24_72,"Chelsea parting ways with Pochettino was the right call. Ok, they won the last five, but they closed the first 19 games with 25 points and they obtained 22 points in the next 13 games. 22 points in 13 games is an average that would yield 64 points in a season, so it's still not satisfactory for a team aiming at UCL. Moreover, Chelsea's defense was abysmal, and basically they won 5 games in a row when every meaningful target was gone, and this is a disaster for a team that wasbleeding money even reaching the UCL quarter finals.

There are so many managers that can perform a better job than Pochettino, given the freedom he had on the transfer market and the infinite amount of money Chelsea spent.

I really don't rate Saliba half as highly as most fans do, think the hype around him has people ignoring how suspect he is at physical contests. I don't think he's defensively exceptional Jarrod Bowen had him beat in the air earlier this season and Bowen isn't particular special in the air.

They had a bad month or 2 period at the start of the year where players were unavailable due to injury, but if you actually looked at the fixtures during that time, apart from Chelsea who were dross anyway, they played almost exclusively bottom half teams or at the very least, teams you should be expected to beat if you want to consider your team in title contention. Even when they played Arsenal, the only starters really missing were Salah and Robertson. Compare that to what the likes of United, Chelsea, Newcastle, Brighton etc have had to deal with continuously throughout the season.

If anything, they actually got worse when all their players regained fitness.

Another thing to add is a lot of teams had their injuries spread across the season, all of liverpools seemed to happen at the same time. This is obviously going to impact them much more. I think the main point here though is it’s the injuries compared to title rivals that people talk about. Arsenal had hardly anyone injured. Average availability of their starting XI was 94%.

He was awful in 20/21, awful in 22/23 and average this season. How can you say he's anywhere near a brilliant player.

This is exactly what I mean about Liverpool fans.

Claiming a team is brilliant based on figures over 2 seasons in embarrassing.

If you had 4 potentially 5 of the best players in world football, with 4 of them playing consistently for the past 5-6 seasons, you'd have won a lot more in the past 4 seasons, instead you have an FA cup and 2x Carabao cups. 4 of those players played consistently every season. 

Liverpool's PL and CL success was 1 trophy per season, Pep has done 3x domestic doubles all with the PL included, 1x domestic treble and an actual treble with PL, CL and FA cup. In Klopps tenure, Pep has had 6 of the best seasons of the 8 Klopp has manager and has the possibility of making it another domestic double this week.

>In todays game, would you rather have Cech prime or Alisson?

Cech, what you don't realise is these were the best players in the game, if they were playing today they would develop into the best players TODAY also. If you gave them the current management, tactical set ups and sports science of today, they would still be at that level. It's why the argument is nonsensical.

Same point.

Thiago was a technically fantastic player but comparing him to Ronaldinho is bonkers. He was a top quality CM but he won't go down anywhere near the level of Kroos, Modric, Iniesta, Xavi, Scholes, Zidane, Seedorf, Kante, Laudrap and many others.

post_24,post_24_92,"Hats off to Chelsea. Too many teams holding on to too many shit managers. It’s insane ETH for example outlasted Poch. Or outlasted the 7-0 but I’m not a United fan, so long may he stay. Newcastle should upgrade managers too. 

Eddie Howe isn’t going to take them any further, no matter how many British people downvote me. Horribly overrated, brutish, mash and gravy tactics spruced up with the odd triangle. Same goes for Thomas Frank, another guy who gets away with playing ISIS-ball. 

Salah/Son seem to be declining at the same rate. Someone here will quote stats about this or that but the eye test here tells me they’ve lost a half yard of pace and are adjusting to it. Son has looked good in some stretches and seems to be slipping into a part of the ensemble, while Salah seems more adrift than ever. Anyway different players but just found it interesting to point out the similar minor but noticeable dip. 

Laughing at Arsenal fans is the best. Why? Because according to them everyone is the best, every new player will be the best, you can say hello to an Arsenal fan and they’ll say did you know we’re the youngest team to blah blah blah. Goes to show how meaningless stats are that the most predictable player in the league somehow statpadded so much G/A. I’ll give you a hint, he chops and cuts inside and spams shot or taps it back to another player or, and most often, just dives. 


Finally this Liverpool coach is going to absolutely suck. They hired their previous coach who brought UCL final experience, now they got a bald guy from the Dutch plumbers league. Worked out great for United and this guy is who’d lose to ten Hag. Imagine being that shit. Hope you enjoyed the run, because it’s over.

post_27,post_27_1,"Contrary to popular opinion, Kompany did actually adjust his style for the Premier League. He definitely went more defensive after the batterings by Chelsea and Spurs early on. We also set up very differently to the Championship season where it was mostly 4123 - we spent most of this season playing some sort of flexible 442.

'What happened' is a combination of inexperience in the squad, difficult fixture list leading to destroyed confidence, poor transfer window(s) (with a record spend too!) and yes, some poor selection, tactical and management decisions from Kompany.

This makes absolutely no sense. Why get players used to playing a way in the Premier League... When you are just going to get relegated again?

Tell that to Barca who wants to sell that guy. For 5 years they have been trying to find his perfect position in the midfield and have failed. 1 year, 2 years you can blame the managers and system, but after half a decade, you have to look at the player. 

Ajax run was impressive, but calling all of their players world class based on one run is far too short sighted. And with time we have seen that they don't have it in them. I don't think they have lived up to the hype. I'm not saying they are bad players, but to call them current leading footballers is rating them a little too much.

And Ten Hag did have merit to win Eredevise but he hasn't shown it with competition in the Prem or CL. The quality of the leagues is miles apart. Not to mention, all his signings have failed terribly at Man Utd. 

We have seen his merits in the Dutch league, but in Prem and in Europe he has shown he's not a top manager. To finish last in a CL group that should have been a 2 race horse, is beyond incompetence.

Because he is a top earner. De Jong came right before Barca basically had to admit that the club had been completely destroyed. They definitely tried to sell him but would only take really high bids and he didn't want to leave. Liverpool and pre-ten Hag United were willing to agree a sum of some 80 million euros. Not bad for a player that has been in a struggling team for years.

>Ajax run was impressive, but calling all of their players world class based on one run is far too short sighted. And with time we have seen that they don't have it in them. I don't think they have lived up to the hype. I'm not saying they are bad players, but to call them current leading footballers is rating them a little too much.

Not just based on that run, they impressed for years on end. The year prior they had been in the EL-final with de Ligt being a starter in that game aged 16. This was before ten Hag, though. Two years later, they won every game in their CL-group with none other than Haller scoring something like 8 goals. Ten Hag made Dusan Tadic, of centre midfield Southampton fame, into one of the most effective strikers in Europe. Barcelona AND Real wanted to sign him in this period, despite him being early 30's at this point. The idea that all of these players necessarily would have to be world class forever is silly.

>And Ten Hag did have merit to win Eredevise but he hasn't shown it with competition in the Prem or CL. The quality of the leagues is miles apart. Not to mention, all his signings have failed terribly at Man Utd. 

Last season United finished a very respectable third. But yes, as has been happening for over a decade now, big name transfers have failed under ten Hag. Casemiro, Varane, Eriksen, Sancho- utter failures. Heavily overpaid for players like Antony or Hojlund. Had Antony been 20 million he'd have been a fun, talented substitute player. 

>We have seen his merits in the Dutch league, but in Prem and in Europe he has shown he's not a top manager. To finish last in a CL group that should have been a 2 race horse, is beyond incompetence.

This season has been a terrible failure. There are some silver linings though and you do have to wonder if it had been much better under a different coach. Tons of injuries and instability.

You could definitely see what he was trying to do at Burnley...but trying to get players who were inexperienced at PL level and/or too young/raw to play counter-pressing tactics against some of the fittest and highest skilled teams in England/ Europe struck me as naivé at best and poorly coached at worst.

But, you could definitely see flashes of what could be.

Bayern would be taking a risk on a young, hungry manager who has learnt from the best but maybe given top level talent could transform Bayern into a dynamic, fast transistion side. Why not?

* Refusing to play Muric until 3/4 of the way into the season. 
* Changing formation week in, week out and not really settling on a starting 11 until it was too late. 
* Playing players out of their natural positions and/or changing their position each week. 
* Not making tactical changes during games when we were getting slaughtered. 
* Poor man-management - side-lining half of the squad that won us a record points total in the championship, causing rifts in the changing room.

Oh yeah, I totally agree. It just sucks we're left relegated with a load of players he signed. Still, there's optimism and if the reports are true we should be getting £20M or so in compensation from Bayern for his departure.

I agree. If things go pear-shaped at Bayern, this is a big risk for his future career. Many of the fans have the feeling this job is too big for him right now. But only time will tell obviously. 

>As a side note: Does Turf Moor have the best view from the top of the stand of any team, anywhere??!

Yes! The view from the top of the Long Side (North Stand) - which is where I usually sit- is widely regarded as one of the best in English football. Bloody cold in winter though.

This might be true, but it doesn't relate to the financial situation of the club. The money the club was bought with and the money VK spent on players was not from the Mormon church. It was a leveraged buyout funded by player sales and external loans.
