Ironically just the archaeologic and forensic anthropology gives a sh*t about genders - its results are strictly and unequivocally bound to biological definition of binary sex from apparent reason: there are no LGBT or transgender teeth or skeletons - only men / women ones, as no one can ask them how sexually confused they can feel..

We can obviously point to cases where individuals won't produce gametes at all, where they will outwardly present as male but have ovaries and vice versa.

Eggs that are functionally useless to them without direct medical intervention?  


A binary definition demands one or the other. A spectral definition says a person can be somewhere along that line. Even if you want to define sex what gametes are produced, you come across cases where no gametes are produced, or true hermaphrodites.

True hermaphroditism, as it’s encountered in other animals, doesn’t exist in humans. There have been no human individual to self fertilize with their own gametes.

The term is an English word originating somewhere around the 15 century and meant male or female. In the late 19th century that was changed to breed, kind, or sex, still referring to the biological reality.

Later, John Money refashioned the term by linking it with identity. That meant making a false distinction between biology and self perception. Since some men and women had slightly varying degrees of masculine and feminine behavior, some even sharing across these lines, political and social groups with converging interests saw an opportunity create social chaos upsetting what they viewed as the oppressive patriarchal dominant class. So behavior became conflated with identity and societal roles were attacked.

The problem with the logic in this is behavior is largely genetic. It's not immutable, but forcing artificial changes in someones behavior leads to disastrous outcomes, as we plainly saw with 2 of Money's victims. Maternal and paternal behaviors are instincts.

Your ""genetic"" claims are not based on anything. I studied biology. Behavior is a result of Hormones, brain wiring and cultural rewards/stimulus.

I know a family with many kids. Some of the boys ended up with their mother's body type and others with their father's. Some ended up with their mother's personality type and others with their fathers. Using this simple example we can see how genetics get mixed and recombined in near random ways. They had at least one miscarriage and so recombination can lead to non viable combinations as well. These are as far as I know all cis people.

For most people societal constructs do match biological ones. We all know people whop are great fits to stereotypes and norms and they have zero social/cultural struggles in society. However Genetics is near random there is no mechanism in the body or in the genome to pair this with that, chains from both parents get taken and filled into a chromosome that is not even necessarily viable as an organism.

Your assumption (aside from your conspiratorial nonsense that has nothing to do with the current discussion) is that EVERYONE must fit because you fit. Biology doesn't work that way, otherwise evolution could not be possible. Mutation and recombination are the mechanism of evolution and genetics. Change and variance are necessary for natural selection to even work...

Its why boys raised by hunters are much more likely to be hunters than boys raised by programmers. Same was true in ancient societies when many sons of lords got into accounting or science or theocracy, not all boys are warriors. Its often cultural, not genetic. My father is a soft and empathetic man, My mother is a hard ass get shit done kind of person. My grandfather was an engineer and in no way a violent hunting hardass of a man that was the norm of his time, his wife went back to work after having kids and was shunned by many. They fail to match the stereotypes and norms in your assumptions but are only within 1 SD of the norm, they were always mocked and ridiculed by the normies despite being very similar. People who differ 2SD and 3SD from the norm (so that's the 10% and less than 1% on the ends of a bell curve) won't. Greeks were known to be tough guy oiled up by little boys gay guys and were shocked when Persian warriors approached wearing eye liner. Koreans have a period of their history they mock in film of how soft and silky and pretend wail-y the ineffective leaders of the Josen period are sometimes depicted to be. I had a flamboyantly gay Korean (from like a mile away) manager who's cousin, an adult man with a family and career, had no idea and said ""some people in my culture are just like that"". If your claim is true when do many men and women chose to become monks or nuns? are they ""not real?"" Why do other cultures not see what you claim as strictly as your universality makes it sound?

Now we understand society is constructed for the ""Norm"" that's obvious and to be expected. The problem is that those who differ should not be stoned to death or jailed (as they are in most countries) nor should their exitance be illegal or invalidated. We should not be banning books that talk about them nor limiting studies (modern studies in the free world) into how other sub sets of culture live. They should be allowed to live and let live.

I'm not shifting goal posts or hair splitting. I've met all these kinds of the people in these communities. They are different and I fail to see the problem. Appeal to nature is also a logical fallacy I will remind you since you seem to think you are immune to fallacy.

The whole ""Its communism"" you allude to is nonsense. Just because the Soviets allowed women to work in most jobs first doesn't invalidate their contributions to businesses does it? Just because the Soviets gave equal rights to Blacks and minorities before the US did (at least on paper) doesn't mean segregation is a ""natural and genetic norm"". Even if that's what some geriatric senators seem to think, because in their era those were not the norm... Also founding fathers in the US wore wigs, makeup and robes... Kinda makes you wonder how norms shift and change over time...

Also your claim to the nuclear family is hilarious. Its only been around for 2 generations in very wealthy western nations. The norm elsewhere is everyone living in the same room for all the living generations.",0.6044850880540292,0.0112488865852355,0.4797326624393463,0.0126442313194274,0,0

why you ask? if you check statistics and with logic alone what is the percentage of a homosexual couple having biological children? without extreme scientific intervention, almost none.

so this helps thin the crowd without any violent reactions and naturally. 

in other species, and i think is applicable too almost all species of animal, when the population reaches a point of imbalance, a violent reaction usually occurs, and in some propagated specie it is called a culture crash. 

i think as a specie that has cognitive ability it has manifested subconsciously and pushed this occurrence to deal with humanities problems in a somewhat harmonious transition rather than a culture crash.

post_10,post_10_8_1_2_1,"As opposed to the corporate establishment media (i.e neoliberal propaganda sites) who will lie to you til this day and tell you that the pfizer jab is an FDA approved vaccine called comirnaty.

It's not. You cannot get an FDA approved covid vaccine in the US. Call pfizer and they'll tell you that it's the same ingredients and formulation as comirnaty. That's a weird response to what should be a simple yes or no question...

And the reason is because they used a different manufacturing process for publicly available vaccines (process 2). If you read the fda approval for comirnaty, it's very clearly based on a singular and established manufacturing process (process 1) 

>An October 2020 amendment to the protocol of the pivotal Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) clinical trial (C4591001) indicates that nearly all vaccine doses used in the trial came from ‘clinical batches’ manufactured using what is referred to as ‘Process 1’.[3] However, in order to upscale production for large-scale distribution of ‘emergency supply’ after authorization, a new method was developed, ‘Process 2’. The differences include changes to the DNA template used to transcribe the RNA and the purification phase, as well as the manufacturing process of the lipid nanoparticles. Notably, ‘Process 2’ batches were shown to have substantially lower mRNA integrity.[4,5]

post_10,post_10_14_9,"Well if you want a serious answer:

One of the reasons is that different viruses operate in different ways. Some have a short infection period and mutate often and for others it's pretty much the opposite. That means with some you could have very strong lifelong immunity from a vaccine, but with others you can only get a strong immunity for a shorter period.

Virus like COVID and the flu that spreads through the air, and infects our breathing system, tend to have a faster rate of mutation. If you get the disease and develop natural immunity from fighting it off, you can still contract it months later, because it's mutated and your body isn't fully prepared for how it's changed.

This is also why there's a lot of talk about updating the vaccines. The vaccines that were rolled out were designed on the original variant. Since then it has mutated a lot and the more it mutated, the less effective the vaccines became. They still had some effects and that's why some received a third shot, while research went into updating the vaccines.",0.0256636456886828,0.0756985545158386,0.4997475147247314,3.445148468017578e-05,0,1

post_10,post_10_20,"This post is just to make you all think about a touchy subject. 

All Covid vaccines are safe and effective for humans and any adverse effects are very very very rare. 

There are no medical journal that have written about Covid vaccines having adverse effects. 

The only sites you will find that speak about Covid vaccines having negative effects are misinformation. 

I believe you can still get banned from many subreddit for speaking anything negative Covid vaccines. So be careful before you speak your mind on the subject. It seems harsh but it would be very dangerous to the world if people had access to information that said that the Covid vaccine is anything but safe and effective. 

We need to control the information the masses have access to for safety. Some people have thoughts that might make people have thoughts that are not in support of vaccines. If there words get out into the public and some people don’t get vaccinated, then can you imagine how scary of a world we would live in?

Even though there is free speech, it is important to monitor speech on social media and ban accounts that speak information that has been deemed dangerous. 

Information such as a person saying they had complications after getting a vaccine and that others should be careful. Unless they are a doctor and they have absolute proof that their illness had anything to do with the vaccine they should not be allowed to speak. They are just reacting to their sickness most of the time and trying to find something to blame. Vaccines are an easy target.

*A report by the nonprofit Society of Actuaries found that [34% more 35- to 44-year-olds died than expected](https://www.soa.org/49b504/globalassets/assets/files/resources/experience-studies/2022/group-life-covid-19-mortality-12-2022.pdf) in the last three months of 2022. More deaths occurred among white-collar vs. blue-collar workers. The organization also reported [a sudden jump in employee deaths](https://www.soa.org/49b504/globalassets/assets/files/resources/experience-studies/2022/group-life-covid-19-mortality-12-2022.pdf) in the fall of 2021. Independent sites aggregating Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data confirm these trends. According to [U.S. Mortality](https://www.usmortality.com/), excess deaths in September 2021 among 25- to 44-year-olds were [70% above normal](https://www.usmortality.com/excess-mortality/percentage/united-states/25-44)*
 
*That number has thankfully dropped, but as of May 2023, the most recent month for which data are available, deaths in this age group remained 10% above expected. Among people under 25, it was [16% above normal](https://www.usmortality.com/excess-mortality/percentage/united-states/0-24). Experts have posited all sorts of theories, from [rising obesity rates](https://fortune.com/well/2023/06/17/america-covid-excess-deaths-worse-other-rich-countries-85-percent/) to [extreme heat](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/07/21/heat-deaths-increase-climate-change-effects-worse/70436488007/) to lagging effects from [lockdowns](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00469580221139016) to wider [alcohol abuse](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791852). These possible contributors deserve careful consideration. Given the [sheer number](https://openvaers.com/covid-data) of COVID-19 vaccine deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, more than 36,000 to date, the possible role of vaccines should be examined, too*.

These questions are getting increasingly rhetoric, given the fact how excess of deaths correlates with vaccination status levels [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/15tp0ah/australian_scientists_find_disturbing_patterns/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceUncensored/comments/16woqzd/covid_vaccines_causally_linked_to_increased/) both in time, both in space.

post_12,post_12_0_1,"Does it correlate? From the article in the original post:

“Comparing state-level excess mortality percentage estimates to estimated COVID-19 vaccinated percentages shows a moderate negative correlation for both the U.S. population and the Group Life data for the third quarter of 2021.
For subsequent periods, although some negative correlation was still seen in most periods, it was less pronounced than the third quarter of 2021. Note that Figure 9.21, which looks at the correlation based on the percent of the population with a completed primary vaccine series and an additional dose (booster) as of December 31, 2021 shows a small positive correlation for the Group Life data for the 2022 period. but with a very low R^2 statistic. which
indicates that vaccination rate does not explain much of the variation in excess mortality.”

Furthermore, when you look at the county level, vaccination status is both more strongly associated  with lower mortality (being negatively associated at all time points) and shows a higher R^2:

“Similar to the state-level analysis for the U.S. population, the county-level analysis shows negative correlation between the excess mortality percentage estimates and the percentages of the population that are fully vaccinated As was the case with the state-level analysis, the third quarter of 2021 shows a steeper slope than the subsequent periods. In comparing the county-level and state-level graphs, the R? statistics suggest a stronger fit at the county level relative to the state level. However, the steeper slopes on the state-level graphs relative to the county-level graphs suggest a larger change in excess mortality per percentage change in vaccination rate at the state level.”

To explain, I will give you a set of declining numbers as they go. Let's say January there was 30 deaths so the cumulative deaths in that time period are 30. In February there is 20 deaths so the cumulative deaths in that time period are 50.  In March there are 10 deaths, so the cumulative deaths over that time are 60.

So which month had worse numbers? Because the cumulative measure was lowest in January and highest in March.  But measuring how fast the cumulative number increases says a different story.

post_12,post_12_8_1_4_1,"Yeah. On page 53:

> Comparing state-level excess mortality percentage estimates to estimated COVID-19 vaccinated percentages shows a **moderate negative correlation** for both the U.S. population and the Group Life data for the third quarter of 2021. For subsequent periods, although some negative correlation was still seen in most periods, it was less pronounced than the third quarter of 2021. Note that Figure 9.21, which looks at the correlation based on the percent of the population with a completed primary vaccine series and an additional dose (booster) as of December 31, 2021, *shows a small positive correlation for the Group Life data for the 2022 period, but with a very low R2 statistic, **which indicates that vaccination rate does not explain much of the variation in excess mortality.***

In other words: The difference is clearly observable and substantial at the beginning in areas where there were more holdouts against getting the vaccine early on (you don’t even need to plot a line to see it). Then, the difference shrinks as more people get the vaccine.

>I’m willing to bet in 10-20 years we will start seeing the real fallout

Who cares? Let's just wait and see. Why do studies now to prevent this? Let's just see what happens. If people die, people die. Why prevent it? In fact let's give all healthy 6 month olds and up perpetual boosters for life and keep injecting more and more novel spike protein, and just wait to see what happens in some years. They have less than 0.1% chance of developing severe covid, but why not reduce that a little bit more, at the exchange of potential death and all hosts of worse complications years down the line? I mean obviously 1+1=3, so the risk-benefit analysis is worth it.

Hey look a study from Harvard, who cares, Harvard was created in 1636 after a group of conspiracy theorists predicted a pandemic in 2020 and then created this insitution so they can publish anti-vaccine and anti-scientific studies like this one:

>Conclusions:  
Immunoprofiling of vaccinated adolescents and young adults revealed that the mRNA vaccine–induced immune responses did not differ between individuals who developed myocarditis and individuals who did not. However, free spike antigen was detected in the blood of adolescents and young adults who developed post-mRNA vaccine myocarditis, advancing insight into its potential underlying cause.

The obvious implication of this study: ignore it completely, and listen to Biden, MD, PhD, and his political institutions CDC/FDA whose board members hop between these organizations and pfizer, when they say this study is a conspiracy theory, that no more studies like this need to be done, and that all 6 month olds and up regardless of health status or previous level of immunity need to keep getting more boosters.",0.0642946274064421,0.1533394455909729,0.4997397363185882,0.0007838308811187,0,0

post_12,post_12_37,"after slavery was banned, comanies worked together with CORRUPTED goverment and CORRUPTED lawyers to add as many laws as possible that imitates the slavery system

&#x200B;

As such, you sign a contract as a worker that you get paid flat rate while the ~~slave master~~ Shareholder get % profit. And the best part, big comanies pay most of thir expenses to other comanies for materials and such. But they pay so much exactly because Shaholders, get thir profit from those comanies as well! like a pyramide scam

&#x200B;

Over the decates, this was better and better shaped until comanies can make bilions in profit, food, energy, medicine, and more, exactly because everyone is dying and suffering due to pandemic, war and such.

&#x200B;

And of course, guards were replaced by managers, HR and police (like not paying debt), and torture and losing famaly was replaces that you need to work or otherwise you family and yourself will suffer and live in misery as everything is to expensive, and of course it's ilegal to live in a car, tent or similar as that would prevent form creating situations where you need to borrow money from banks that enable more profit for sharheolders.

&#x200B;

we can't afford anything just like slave, unless we sign contract that enslaves us or we go in prison, so of course we will work. And even if we have rights,like a animals, we don't have the privilege to get them, like how animals are pets, livestock or even if they don't want to become another animals food, they have no chose as no one will save them

We are one step away from slavery. And the effects are the same effect you see in slavery. I mean, did you not realise? no one, absolutly no one, called out and penelised the corrupted that made bilions in profit, exactly because they increased the prices (they are LEGALLY ALLOWED <- why?????) insted of reducing it to 0% profit exactly because of world crisis and people dying and suffering.",0.2132386765939596,0.0106008052825927,0.4873527586460113,9.894371032714844e-06,0,1

The number of CD3-positive T-cells by far outnumbered the few CD20-positive B-cells detected. In addition, most T-cells belonged to the CD4-positive subset, while only scattered CD8-positive T-cells were seen (Fig. 1, 2, Supplementary Fig. 1/2). The T cells were negative for Tbet as a marker for Th1 cells, GATA3 as a marker for Th2 cells, D2-40, as a marker for Th17 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2).

No offense but 1/5 mortality from this claim should have killed someone I know or worked with since the medical lab I worked at had a voluntary 99% vaccination rate. I know hundreds of vaccinated people and none have had any issues.

If excess mortality rose in April in the US but the vaccines only became available in December of the same year (and were not widely distributed for months) and there is no significant spike in December how can you relate the two? Why do low compliance and high compliance states show very similar data? Surely by your hypothesis states like NY should have much higher Mortality than Texas, whereas the data shows them to be almost identical.

In Canada Excess Mortality rose in April 2020 but the vaccine did not become available until spring 2021 as the government insisted on having the studies redone in Canada?

Cause cannot predate effect.

Do you think the virus that caused internal organs to rupture/leak and form scar tissue might have adverse impacts in some individuals? Its not conclusive but damn is it highly suggestive. Certainly fits the timeline better too.

I remember when the outbreak hit France and young people began dying of heart failure.

The conspiracy in the US prior to vaccination was that doctors signed heart attack and lung failure deaths as COVID mortalities.

[The quantum engine compresses a gas of particles that are bosons and decompresses a gas of particles that are fermions](https://i.imgur.com/Ld43FpL.jpg)


*To turn fermions into bosons, you can take two fermions and combine them into a molecule. This new molecule is a boson. Breaking it up allows us to retrieve the fermions again. By doing this cyclically, we can power the engine without using heat. In the case of the quantum engine, the researchers used extremely cold lithium atoms and an approach called [Feshbach resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feshbach_resonance). This allows for the system to be in a BEC with a small volume and a piston pushing down; as the BEC is turned into a fermion gas, its volume expands, pushing the piston away.*

The pressure of the medium is about 100 times LESS than the pressure in interplanetary space. No energy is applied, but  to change quantum state the frequency control of the magnetic field is used (83.22 mT) - and this will probably consume some energy. The temperature during cycle does not change, it remains 0.000000012 degrees above absolute zero. See also:

post_14,post_14_0_1,"[Feshbach resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feshbach_resonance) occurs when the energy of motion of the colliding atoms is equal to the energy of the bound state (molecule or boson in the above example). At resonance, the effective cross section of the colliding atoms in the s state (zero angular momentum diet) increases rapidly and the probability of a molecule forming increases. 

If the molecules have a magnetic moment, the energy of the emerging molecule can be affected by the magnetic field. By choosing the magnetic field strength, the desired resonance can be achieved. The molecular condensate preparation produces a cloud containing a mixture of atomic and molecular BEC. If the magnetic moments of the atoms and molecules are different, a gradient magnetic field acting against gravity can be used to separate the two components. 

The magnetic field was chosen in such a way that the molecular component remained in place (levitated against gravity) and the other, atomic component was accelerated away. In the experiment, the initial number of caesium atoms was about 50,000 and the resonance produced approximately 3,000 molecules in the BEC phase. The atomic condensate was accelerated upwards by the magnetic field (acceleration 0.61 g, in 3 ms the cloud of atoms separated from the cloud of molecules) and the cloud of molecular BEC levitated in the device.",0.0243858806556069,0.4421977996826172,0.4997226297855377,0.0191738307476043,1,0

The cancel culture is a problem, bc people have stopped listening to anything that goes against their logic (this used to be a right-wing thing), so all they are left w is their dogma. Things like gender is on a spectrum. Ask a biologist if that's true, they will laugh at you, but then they will be cancelled. Striving to find the truth has become problematic, even w simple things. 

Toxic masculinity is another, it started off as a description of certain types of really bad behaviour, but then slowly ballooned out to describe men in general. Men should just act more like women... the consequences of that is that young men don't approach women any more, bc ofc they don't want to be toxic. There's a whole list of problems that come w this.

There's the one where men and woman are the same, their are no sex differences. I'm always stunned when this has to explained. I still don't understand why people are so offended if men and woman are different.

We are all centralists just divided. All humans have a uniting common sets of beliefs that we are separated from by indoctrination. Only the select few minority are split from the norm. There is a uniting force among humanity but the internet has fractured this divide giving the viewpoint of false radicalism where the radicals are actually few and far between. The only thing separating people truly is intelligence and ignorance where you can see intelligent people collect into similar places of higher wealth and less intelligent people collect into areas of lower wealth at least that is my viewpoint and my truth from real world experience.

post_21,post_21_3_5_3_2_1_2_1_1_1,"The rise in people identifying as trans, especially young girls undergoing puberty, may point to it being in part due to social contagion.

There's been no research that I know of into this rise, but the NHS performed a rapid pull back in their gender affirming care model in order to allow research to be conducted to make sense of the rapid rise.  Are there just that many more trans people than initially expected, or are people that aren't trans shopping around until they get a diagnosis to receive care?  

Peterson has a fixation on blaming society's impending collapse on one thing.  Usually it's ""post-modernism"".  He raises valid points, but the arguments are typically shallow or just bad faith.

I believe it's a sore spot for him, since he was initially ""cancelled"" (very broad definition of this, since he's financially doing better than ever) for misgendering someone.  

It's likely that he's a bit transphobic, but he's a hardline Christian tradcon.  People shouldn't expect him to have the most liberal opinions when it comes to the LGBTQ+ community to begin with.

*[Study validates](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085\(23\)05075-8/fulltext) that [pyrvinium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrvinium), a drug that has been used for decades for intestinal pinworms, can be repurposed as a preventative treatment for stomach cancer. In details, pyrvinium acts through the following main mechanisms: (i) energy and autophagy depletion; and (ii) inhibition of Akt and Wnt-β-catenin-dependent pathways.*


Pyrvinium  could apparently work against additional cancers, than just stomach cancer. BTW It just happens that Ivermectin - a drug, which is also a dewormer - was recently found to have anticancer activity too. Pyrvinium is chemically close to hydroxychloroquine though (which is also a quinolinium derivative), but hydroxychloroquine doesn't lack anticancer activity also.

post_25,post_25_9,"ChatGPT is our friend: “Hello, this is Bing. I'm here to chat with you and answer your questions. 😊

The statement you shared is partially true, but also exaggerated. Let me explain.

It is true that satellite data shows that this year's ozone hole over Antarctica is one of the biggest on record, roughly three times the size of Brazil or twice the size of Antarctica itself¹²³. The ozone hole is a natural phenomenon that occurs every year during the Antarctic winter, when cold air creates polar stratospheric clouds that deplete the ozone layer, which protects us from harmful ultraviolet rays⁴.

However, it is not true that the eruption of Tonga's underwater volcano in January 2022 is the main cause of the large ozone hole. Scientists are not sure why this year's ozone hole is so large, but some researchers have speculated that the volcanic eruption could be one of the factors that contributed to it, along with other natural variability and climate change¹²⁵. The eruption injected a record-breaking amount of water into the stratosphere, which could have caused cooling and more formation of polar stratospheric clouds⁵.

The statement that we can't live above ground if the hole gets bigger is also false and alarmist. The ozone hole does not affect the amount of ozone in other parts of the world, and it usually closes by the end of November when the stratosphere warms up⁴. The international community has banned the use of ozone-depleting substances since 1989, and the ozone layer is expected to recover by the end of this century⁴. However, we still need to be careful about our exposure to UV rays and protect our skin and eyes from sun damage.

I hope this clarifies your question. If you have any other questions or want to chat about something else, feel free to ask me. 😊

*The researchers then focused on the roughly 9,000 people from the total group who went into cardiac arrest in a public place (as opposed to a private residence) and found bystanders gave CPR to more men (68 per cent) than women (61 per cent). They found only 54 per cent were given CPR by a bystander. When the researchers looked at cardiac arrests in private settings, older women were more likely to receive CPR than older men.*

*Research shows some people fear they will be accused of sexual harassment if they give a woman CPR
Yet all Australian states and territories have Good Samaritan laws which protect bystanders acting in good faith
Some CPR trainers are tackling this issue by using female-presenting mannequins in classes.*

After this quoted section, they carry on to speak about CPR training and mannequin breasts, and finish with best practices for bra removal during codes (underwire/defibrillator).

""Clinical and interventional cardiologist Fiona Foo said this gender disparity in CPR rates was one of several reasons why women with heart disease have poorer outcomes compared to men.

She said it was noteworthy that even paramedics were more likely to give CPR to a man than a woman (40 per cent versus 36 per cent), according to 2019 data from NSW.

""The public and doctors still don't feel that women have heart disease or are going to have a cardiac arrest,"" she said.

""There's still this thought that women don't die of heart disease when it is actually the second-leading cause of death in women in Australia after dementia.""

Why aren't women given CPR?

Research suggests there's three main reasons behind this reluctance:

fear of inappropriate touching

fear of causing injury because women are ""physically weak or fragile""

poor awareness of a woman being in cardiac arrest.""",0.0452176597822324,0.414469301700592,0.4997515678405761,0.0222544372081756,0,0

If I don't help, the worst thing that happens is that people think I'm kind of a dick, assuming anyone knows that I noticed and didn't help at all. I don't lose access to my livelihood, I don't lose nearly as much reputation, comparatively, I don't really lose anything at all.

So, why bother? A basic cost-benefit analysis says that it isn't worthwhile, not because of anything that I may or may not gain, but because of what I may or may not lose. And I am not willing to, nor is it acceptable to demand that I, risk any part of a life that I am quite enjoying on a complete dice roll of an action.

As for statistical insignificances, the ridiculously vast majority of men do not rape, have never thought of raping, and will never rape. Yet, such accusations are things that we must worry about in the modern day, because the modern legal system has proven that it is lucrative for women to accuse someone, because they will be publicly showered with affection and support before any proof is ever offered and gone over by actual professionals in an actual court of law. People like you are just mad that it's your turn to be worried about a statistical insignificance, perhaps you shouldn't have set such a precedent.",0.3072120056777915,0.0347703695297241,0.4997245371341705,9.775161743164062e-06,0,0

I always found it funny how politically correct people seem to forget that people are human beings.  When I was a kid, it was the conservatives, but nowadays it seems to be the left...  Its really very simple, human beings are human, they feel emotions, they observe potential risks, they feel anxiety, depression, happiness, sadness, etc.  Seeing someone dieing pulls on the emotions and makes the average person want to help.  But the potential risk that might go along with helping also plays a factor, which increases anxiety and so on.  In fact, most people won't jump in to do CPR out of anxiety for what ever reason they have, outside of male to female CPR.  Thats just a fact, when tragedy strikes, most people are not the sort of person you want to lean on for it.  Adding in a potential sexual assault allegation, well that just creates a perfect excuse for someone to say ""welp, fuck that I am not doing that.""  Its a very human response.

Maybe, maybe not.  But the risk is still present.  The difficulty getting a job, the per-requisite of filing where you move, not being within x amount of feet of a school building.  Getting the sex offender stigma attached to you is incredibly damaging for a plethora of reasons.  While it is understandable, its also incredibly horrifying if you are wrongfully accused.

Social death in humans tends to generate despair, anxiety, depression, etc.  Being a social recluse has a stigma attached to it for a reason, and it is not good.

Morals are simply rules in which you live your life by.  Bravery is simply the ability to overcome ones own fears.  If someone is realizes a risk, and is afraid of taking said risk they have perceived, and then faces it head on and does it anyway, that is brave, whether or not you believe it or not.

>I just do what I want I want to do.

So that is your moral code.  You essentially don't empathize with others, and you look out for what you want, and not what others want. 

>I just can't believe people are so stuck in their imagination that they get paralyzed by it.

We are all in our imaginations lol.  It is actually impossible to perceive everything, its your brain that is filling in the blanks all of the time.  For instance, did you know your peripheral vision is actually in black and white?  The reason people don't realize this is because our brain straight up fills in the missing information with what ever it imagines, which turns out tends to be pretty accurate.  When ppl take hallucinogens you are actually playing with that aspect of human perception, and forming new neural pathways, which is whyt there is a following for ppl to experiment with them to see things in a different light and even help deal with things like depression and anxiety.

post_30,post_30_0,"I find it bizarre that not a single person has compared the pandemic responses of countries like USA and Canada to their obesity response (or lack thereof).

They treated the pandemic like a war, necessitating lockdowns, suspension of medical informed consent and forcing people to get medical interventions against their will, etc...

Yet they have largely ignored obesity, and continue to do so. What is interesting is that during the first covid wave in the USA, even the CDC admitted that 4/5 in ICU were obese. But of course, instead of tackling obesity, they instead told obese children to get the vaccine while going to and from McDonalds, and were incentivizing people with free unhealthy food to get the vaccine:

[https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/24/business/vaccine-freebies/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/24/business/vaccine-freebies/index.html)

Let's return to the article in the OP I posted:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910458/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910458/)

Look at Figure 1:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910458/figure/f01/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910458/figure/f01/)

It is similar in the USA:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity\_in\_the\_United\_States#/media/File:Obesity\_in\_the\_United\_States.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Obesity_in_the_United_States.svg)

The rise of obesity occurred in lockstep with the rise of neoliberalism.

In practice: neoliberalism is a political/economy ideology that was initiated in the late 70s/early 80s by Western countries such as USA/UK/Canada, etc... it means these countries were run by an oligarchy that comprised of politicians and corporations who had so much influence that in practice they ran the countries. One of the implications of this was the fast food/junk food industry through their mammoth amounts of money and advertisements ""normalizing"" junk/fast food. As a result, obesity were from virtually not being a thing, to something like around 1 in 5 people being obese in Western countries.

Let's look at the top 10 causes of death in countries like USA/Canada, notice how most of them are either caused by or exacerbated by obesity (including covid):

[https://www.healthline.com/health/leading-causes-of-death](https://www.healthline.com/health/leading-causes-of-death)

Obesity kills far more people than 9/11 did (this resulted in 2 wars and 1+ million people dying), than the pandemic did, than most other things. Yet there is barely any movement in terms of trying to stop it.

Yet what are these governments doing to tackle obesity? Pretty much nothing. Now contrast it to their war time effort for the pandemic. It really helps recognize their priorities. Is it public health? Or the profit of the corporations who fund their election campaigns and other influences they have on them? Covid was bad for profit (lockdowns hurt profit) and also politically bad (hospital system collapsing would be political suicide for any politician in power) and also covid vaccines made a lot of people rich with board members of people in CDC/FDA hopping to and from board of corporations like pfizer, but obesity is good for profit (it makes the fast/junk food industry rich/it increases GDP due to weight loss products and increased hospitalizations and need for medical services, supplements, gyms, etc..).",0.0375787637977471,0.0169950723648071,0.499720424413681,1.4483928680419922e-05,0,1
