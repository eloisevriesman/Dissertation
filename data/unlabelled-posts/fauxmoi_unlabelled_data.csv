It could help smaller venues compete, and not have to pay to use Ticketmaster. But Ticketmaster and live nation would still possibly have the biggest share of the industry. 

Bur this could possibly lead to more legislation or regulations in the industry, I hope.

Not so fun, and also not surprising fact: the vast majority of family annihilators (people who murder their whole family and then usually themselves in one act) are men. 

The usual type is men who are middle aged men, elementary school aged children, a history of domestic violence, and suicidal thoughts. The usual thought process for these family annihilators is that they want to kill themselves, but they don’t want their wife and kids to live without them. It’s an entirely selfish mindset that I can’t wrap my head around.

post_8,post_8_12_1,"Tbh I think Hollywood probably makes makes all the reasons why a hot dude would smell bad worse. Like, it encourages eating disorders, but chain smoking to keep the weight off or purging due to bulimia would make someone's breath horrible. It popularizes pseudoscientific health nonsense, much of which will at best not make you smell better and more likely will actively make you smell worse. It insulates a lot of people from the real world and its consequences, which means some people may never know that they're one of the stinky ones, and those who do don't need to care. And if a famous person is struggling with self care due to mental illness or neurodivergence, I can see how it would make sense to prioritize looks over smell, even though for most people in the real world that would not be the case.",0.5555994569466136,0.0398533940315246,0.499570369720459,1.829862594604492e-05,0,1

- straight-up bad habits and apathy 

- never really having had to make an effort and assuming people will be happy to take them in whatever state they arrive 

- mental illness or neurodivergence that’s not being well-managed

- a flex towards “masculinity” especially as a response to being labeled a pretty-boy or having to engage in the “girly” physical/aesthetic maintenance routines required to keep their status

- thinking it makes them “real” and “connected to their body” unlike people “hiding” their animal nature behind artificial scents [this may be pulled from personal experience]

Ryan Reynolds: it’s the same formula but nothing has come out about him or anything. But I find his persona and social media verrrry manufactured and fake. Don’t trust him

post_11,post_11_1,"Shortly after a Memphis judge ruled in favor of Riley Keough blocking a foreclosure auction of Graceland and calling for an investigation into Riley's claims of fraud, Naussany Investments has backed off.


**A representative for the company, Naussany Investments & Private Lending, said in an email statement that it would withdraw all of its claims over Graceland.**


**Naussany Investments had claimed that Elvis Presley’s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley - who died last year at age 54 - had used Graceland as collateral when borrowing $3.8 million** that was never repaid, according to a public notice of the intended sale.


Presley's granddaughter, actress Riley Keough – who inherited the home after her mother's death – sued Naussany, asserting that her mother never took out the loan and that Naussany was engaged in fraud, including forging her mother's signature on multiple documents.


**In a sworn affidavit attached to the lawsuit, the notary public listed on Naussany's documents said she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized her signature.**


In a statement, **Gregory Naussany, whose role in the company is not clear, said it would ""be withdrawing all claims"" and proceeded to blame Riley's mother, Lisa Marie Presley. He did not directly address Keough's allegations of fraud**.


""Due to the Deed of Trust not being recorded and the loan being obtained in different state, legal action would have to be filed in multiple states and NAUSSANY Investments & Private Lending will not acquire to proceed. That comes from consultation of the lawyers for the company. **There was no harm meant on Ms. Keough for her mothers LMP mis habits and mis managing of money**. The company will be withdrawing all claims with prejudice""


**In a statement, Elvis Presley Enterprises, which operates Graceland, said, ""As the court has now made clear, there was no validity to the claims. There will be no foreclosure.""**",0.0337861463633446,0.4233489036560058,0.4995858073234558,6.717443466186523e-05,0,1

The fact that at this hearing ""Naussany Investments & Private Lending"" didn't even show up and their side was ""argued"" by a fax received by the court signed by ""Gregory Naussany"" doesn't help.  

I think the Daily Mail is the only media source claiming any kind of evidence any of these people exist, in that they say they reached out to the Naussany's at an e-mail address in the court filings and they got back an e-mail saying that after yesterday's ruling were dropping their legal complaints.

. . .which doesn't make a lot of sense.  If they actually were owed millions of dollars you'd think they'd try to recoup it, but the explanation that the Daily Mail said they gave in their e-mail didn't make a lot of sense

They claimed that since they lived in one state, and Graceland is in another, they'd have to file the suit in multiple states and how that would be so time consuming and difficult. . .except that's not how civil litigation works in the US.  In a case like that, it would become a matter for Federal court under what's called ""diversity jurisdiction"" (specifically to prevent that sort of situation)

If they ACTUALLY were an investment firm that was making multi-million dollar loans, you'd THINK they'd have access to legal advice (since they weren't represented in court, since ""Gregory Naussany"" is not listed as being admitted to the Bar in any state) and even a first-year law student would know what I just said about diversity jurisdiction.  

So, that's yet another reason this is looking like a scam by some forger to steal Graceland, that they're having to run from because someone fought it.

Also, can we make a cultural movement back towards turning remixes of songs into completely new absolute fuckin BANGERS? The 90s r&b, rap, and hip hop remixes were the BEST, and often totally leveled up solid or even genuinely great tracks into creatively reimagined gems. Or, at the very least, you could see and hear the effort put into the remix by the artists involved, instead of jamming a rap in the middle or at the front and calling it a day.",0.2839129267544122,0.0144196152687072,0.4993859827518463,0.0004629492759704,0,1

post_15,post_15_4_3,Releasing remixes itself isn’t the problem. It’s the producing of multiple physical versions that she criticized. As far as I know her remixes are exclusively online. I think you can at least make an argument for the artistic merit of producing alternate versions of the same songs with different production vs releasing the same album with different bonus tracks thus incentivizing fans to buy multiple versions of that album.,0.0247193477769475,0.2714769244194031,0.4997723400592804,7.432699203491211e-05,0,1

post_15,post_15_4_3_2,I just looked at this entire remix album is $7 and only available for 24 hours. And not available internationally. It’s kind of a collectors item and she knows it’s obviously going to be shared for free somehow after she takes it down past the 24 hours. I prefer this like you said compared to releasing 5 bonus tracks but you have to physically buy 5 different vinyls to hear 5 extra songs. That’s insanity. And she dropped an extended remix of this fan favorite part of a song people were already wishing was longer and I’ve had that on a loop. Now I don’t have to listen to one song to get to the part I like at the very end. She’s being smart about it and doesn’t feel like you HAVE to collect everything bc her fan base probably wants to be eco friendly as well compared to Taylor’s fan base. I’m sure there are collectors but I don’t get the vibe that’s what Billie wants her fans to do. She has to play the game. Even Beyonce does a few variants. But it’s how you approach it and I’m sure there will be other singles and remixes that Billie drops but no other artist is blatantly trying to block someone’s success each week in a super obvious way than Taylor.

Can be paper, plastic coatings, harmful toxic chemicals that wind up in landfills or cannot be incinerated and if they are, those particles become microplastics, unless she is having them print eco-friendly biodegradable stickers that are made of recyclable materials.

post_23,post_23_1_2,"Yes, absolutely, and I will add on: the silencing and erasure of Arab voices entirely by vilifying and demonizing our language. When we say “Intifada” it only means “to shake off” something by rising — not violence. When we say “martyrs” we mean all untimely deaths — we call people who drown martyrs, too, or people who die of cancer. But Western media has decided that it means “dying while fighting” and are using that as a “gotcha” against us. We can’t even mourn the martyred children, whose only crime was to be born on the wrong side of an arbitrary border, without having to go on immediate defense about our language. The way that our entire language and culture are so quickly and easily demonized and policed is so wild to me. An Arab cannot speak without being called barbaric and violent by Western media.

post_23,post_23_7_1,I have seen this phrase a few times. I know Saoirse means freedom because I went to school with two twins named Saoirse and Siobhan.

post_29,post_29_6,"Her request for victims to not cut off their people is so real. I was abused for five years and towards the end, I felt like I had no friends left because he was SO good at getting me to isolate myself from others and I didn’t realize it happened until there was no one I could turn to. I stayed cause I thought I’d die if I left, and left because I knew I’d die if I stayed. I was fortunate to forge a connection with an old friend to help get me out. You need people, period. 

And she’s right that the journey never ends. Happily married now and I couldn’t watch the video nor can I consume any content that even hints towards domestic violence (sorry to Blake lively and Justin baldoni, I guess).

As a stranger I’m grateful she’s able to bask in love, SAFETY, comfort, and find healing surrounded by her loved ones. Our duty is to not let only “sensational” stories be the motivation to seek justice- there’s countless victims in our everyday lives who need our help, our love, our encouragement, our strength, our hand.
