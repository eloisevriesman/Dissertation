It was replaced pre-race with a shoddy replica that just fell off at one point because it wasn't secured on properly. Although this would likely require someone knowing the diamond would be on the car well ahead to get a somewhat matching piece. Which likely makes this unlikely.

The more common explanation is that it just fell of sometimes during the race and was pocketed by someone or even just straight up destroyed. The car was in a crash wasn't it?
