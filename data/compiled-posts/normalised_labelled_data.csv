The season before that they had one of the leagues best defences, the fact it fell apart because 90% of the players were injured and they lost Raya also speaks volumes. Long term injuries to both starting wingbacks all season as well, it's really unfair to say they had a shite team, shite depth, yes, but their starting 11 is comfortably mid-table.

You also don't know what you're talking about regarding Toney, who was utter shit when he returned and has had one eye on a move since. Brentford played better football when he wasn't on the pitch with a Wissa - Mbuemo - KLP front 3 than they ever did when he started this season, and again Mbuemo was injured from December - March, and Wissa went to AFCON for part of that.

The fact Frank kept them up with plenty of games to go is a testament to his abilities as a manager, but there is no denying that it would have been dicier in a more normal year. Hopefully this a wake up call on the recruitment side of things, especially if Frank decides to go elsewhere, because the squad needs depth and strengthening in key areas this season, there is always a risk of stagnating and collapsing in the Premier League.",1,0,0.3805813287947117,0.0121359229087829,0.4983566999435425,0.0034952163696289,0,1

The original peer-reviewed LK99 superconductor paper only briefly mentions the thin film work and measurements. In August and September 2023, the consensus of other labs was that LK-99 is not a superconductor at any temperature but only bulk non-thin film samples have been made. None of replications have gone through the peer-review process of a journal.

However, this is the most important part because only the chemical vapor deposited thin film has the zero resistance superconducting measurement.  The original team says that the thin film chemical vapor deposition process is the only one that has superconducting resistance. The thin film is microns thick and is nearly half superconductive material. See also:

Intriguingly most people in comments never noticed them before. A little white worms found in beef can be a tapeworm species known as Taenia saginata, Taenia solium, Taenia asiatica etc. They in fact cause a parasitic infection called taeniasis in humans.

ScienceUncensored_data,post_5,post_5_1,"I show here the bizarre contradiction of basic statistics and common sense that was used:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/15tq0vd/the\_bizarre\_study\_that\_was\_used\_to\_practically/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/15tq0vd/the_bizarre_study_that_was_used_to_practically/)

The tl;dr is: they downplayed a study with sufficient sample size due to arbitrary/subjective reasons (that the ""endpoint"" was not ""good enough"" even though according to common sense it was clinically meaningful)... and yet they based their decision on another study that had an insufficient sample size: this study only had about 250 people in the fluvoxamine group and around the same number of people in the placebo group. For a disease that causes less than 5% severe illness in people without any immunity, to begin with, that means roughly only 10 people out of 250 would be expected to get severe illness even without any sort of intervention or vaccine. So when you only have around 250 in each group, and around 15 might get severely ill... fluvoxamine would be expected to lower that number of 15 but not by 100%.. so perhaps it might lower it to something like 7 or 8.. and in the placebo group because there is no intervention we would expect around 15.. but in this study they found only 15 in placebo group vs 13 in fluvoxamine group.. well.. when your sample size is so small.. those numbers are way too small to draw any conclusions from..

The other study (that they dismissed due to their subjective/arbitrary decision that the ""endpoint"" was not ""good enough"").. had a much higher sample size.. around 750 in each group.. and they found 119 in the placebo group clinically deteriorated vs 79 in the placebo group... \[119 vs 79\] vs \[15 vs 13\].. 15 vs 13? Are you kidding me? That is way too small for both groups to draw any meaningful conclusions from. Yet they chose to base their decision on that study, and strangely downplayed the study that showed 119 vs 79. It is quite literally bizarre that they can get away with something like that. It is basic math, logic, and common sense, but again, very few people care about these things, and only around 2% of people can understand these basic statistical concepts, this is how they get away with their bizarre decisions.",0,1,0.0480130448683132,0.564259946346283,0.4997012615203857,2.950429916381836e-05,0,1

Here we can see [a picture of colliding galaxies](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hsXrp8Xs3dq8CVPo25KATK-1920-80.jpg), this one on the bottom NGC 2937 is definitely much older (oval and yellowish) and as such surrounded by thick coat of dark matter. It looks smaller but it's actually much heavier just thanks to invisible field of dark matter around it. The  NGC 2936 galaxy ""above"" it is younger (the pink clouds of molecular hydrogen are still forming in it) and being lightweight it collides and wraps around dark matter field of NGC 2937 galaxy at distance. Like if the old galaxy would be surrounded by a thick coat of invisible jelly or something similar.  

The visible matter separating effect of dark matter manifests itself just with [distinct color pattern of galaxies](http://i.imgur.com/UFsfUZb.jpg). The core of most of galaxies (including Milky Way) is formed with yellowish older mature stars of high metallicity, despite the concentration of interstellar gas is maximal there. These stars remain cold and yellow, because they're starving of interstellar gas which is kept hot with dark matter so that it can not gravitate into stars and power nuclear fusion there.

With compare to it, the galactic arms have blue color, which means, they're formed with hot short living and freshly formed stars. The extreme example of this paradox is the [Hoag's object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoag's_Object), which is probably merger of two galaxies of very different age. See also:

we just have to guess on whether it is true or not.

Personally I am not too convinced, because this is Pfizer yet Moderna had identical side effects, does this mean the exact same production problem happened with Moderna? And not just Pfizer and Moderna, but virtually all spike protein based vaccines, regardless of whether they are mRNA or not, cause abnormally/astronomically higher rate of adverse effects compared to non covid vaccines. Also, Moderna has a higher rate of adverse effects, and we know it has 3x as much mRNA so 3x as much spike protein. And there are studies showing the spike protein independently appears to be causing heart issues. So my own hypothesis is that these vaccine adverse effects are due to the unnatural toxic spike protein of this accidentally lab leaked artificial virus, and the more spike protein you get the higher chances of symptoms. That would explain why the virus, and all spike protein based vaccines, are all causing the same sorts of symptoms. It would also explain why milder covid results in relatively less long covid symptoms but can still cause long covid symptoms: less spike protein proliferates in the body but there is spike protein in the body nevertheless.",0,1,0.0295429554215693,0.0155954957008361,0.499721497297287,5.0008296966552734e-05,0,1

> What is TTS?

>Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is a rare condition reported in some people who have received adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines [such as the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine]. The syndrome is characterised by blood clot formation (thrombosis) combined with low platelet levels (thrombocytopenia).
> TTS is different to other more commonly diagnosed blood clotting conditions as it is triggered by an immune response that causes the combination of both clots and low platelets.
>Having a history of blood clots, like deep vein thrombosis (DVT), does not increase your risk of TTS due to the AstraZeneca vaccine.



> Risk of death due to TTS from receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is 1 in a million

> Risk of TTS from receiving the AstraZenecaCOVID-19 vaccine is less than 30 in a million

>  Risk of death due to rock climbing is 3 in a million

One thing I didn't know is:

>Deaton said rightwing politicians and economists fixed the numbers so they could claim, in the words of Ronald Reagan, that in the war on poverty, poverty won. Official income statistics left out welfare payments so those receiving them often appeared to still be living below the poverty line when, by other measures, government assistance demonstrably helped.

I've always wondered about this.  I prefer creativity and socialization over consumption, which means I spend very little.  So because of that despite having plenty of money, I tend to spend below the poverty line out here in Silicon Valley, which is about 57k.

If I ate out every day of the year at a decent sit down restaurant I would spend 36k, combined with an above median rent of $2000 a month I'd spend 60k a year, I'd be just over the poverty limit.  This seems insane to me.  I can live comfortably, regularly travel to Europe for vacation, eat out, have a decent reliable car, and still be in poverty?  The numbers always seemed off to me.  Apparently out here all those things are not enough to be considered a liveable wage.

Now to be fair, that would be a bit tough with a kid, but the poverty limit is set based on size of household, so 57k is one person.  It goes up for two people, and a kid is a 3rd person, so it goes up higher to account for that.",0,1,0.0415525095717269,0.0270426273345947,0.4997518062591553,0.001045137643814,0,0
ScienceUncensored_data,post_17,post_17_3,"Hey hey guys, a British royal title guy who has been working and teaching at Princeton since the 1980s is now on the side of the poor!! For real guys.

He's seriously concerned about white people dying, especially via what he and Case call [deaths of despair](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190785/deaths-of-despair-and-the-future-of-capitalism), i.e. drug and alcohol deaths and suicides. Of course our polluted water and air and food haven't played a role, duh! Or any of that other stuff. We've been CHOOSING to poison OURSELVES!!

And you know what else doesn't play a role, because Case and Deaton didn't even think to mention it in their book? Student debt. BOOM. Economists from Princeton know that crushing debt is sort of like, an insignificant detail. Because of course no one who hasn't graduated has student debt, and in fact, college educated people are currently [flourishing.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/opinion/life-expectancy-college-degree.html) (\*\* please correct me if I'm wrong. I thought I paid careful attention while listening to their book but could've missed something. \*\*)

You can tell Deaton really cares about the poor because he's promoting progressive policies like [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/opinion/life-expectancy-college-degree.html):

>We are encouraged by the efforts of both public and private employers to remedy this; it is a low-cost policy that could have large benefits. For example, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania signed an executive order removing the B.A. requirement for 92 percent of state jobs; similar policies are in place in Utah, Maryland, Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey and Alaska.  
>  
>Anything that reduces health care costs would help, as would replacing employer-funded health insurance with vouchers paid for by general taxation. Fighting NIMBYism (residents’ “not in my backyard” opposition to local development) and expanding affordable housing in successful cities would increase mobility. Job creation under the Inflation Reduction Act is a move in the right direction. Working people would do better with stronger unions and fewer hostile measures such as right-to-work laws.

Did he say ""vouchers""? Oh wait . . . is Sir Dr. Deaton from Princeton possibly trying to distract us from ACTUALLY progressive policies, such as universal health care, free (and public?) post-secondary education, stricter water, air, and land protections, undoing the hoarding of real estate by the wealthy, more rigorous food safety standards, jobs guarantees, student debt relief, support for small farmers and action against conglomerate farms, etc. Though it is cool he is advocating for unions . . . but history shows that union gains can be easily undone as needed. Hmmmmmm.

(And a bit of extra fun, the Princeton economists also say that its our [mental distress](https://qz.com/583595/deaths-of-despair-are-killing-americas-white-working-class) that caused some of us to support Bernie Sanders, rather than any sincere and rational belief in the need for collective action.

Also ""millions"" is just a ""whoa this sounds big!"" but considering that there live ""millions"" of people in GB you are at what order of magnitude? Right, 1 pound per person per year. Maybe as low as a tenth or as high as 10 times that. _Depending on how many millions._

Arguing the grid needs to be expanded **requires** a cost analysis. Perhaps expanding the grid is more expensive than shutting down a few wind turbines? Perhaps we can find a nice formula or even an easy rule of thumb to determine a threshold for policymakers and utilities. Of course the cost analysis would have to take into account the value of each kWh curtailed at the time it is curtailed. Obviously the price of electricity is not constant.

NeutralPolitics_data,post_1,post_1_1,"I'm going to limit my comments to Wagner *in Ukraine*. [Here's a link to an article on Wagner in Africa post-Prigozhin.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-30/russia-recruiting-africa-army-to-replace-wagner-group?srnd=politics-vp) This may already be a rambling comment; it's a rambling, sprawling topic. I also don't deserve to be the spokesperson on this topic ... but everything else got deleted and I think I can do well enough.

In Ukraine, [Wagner was officially disbanded.](https://time.com/6290536/russia-wagner-group-disbanded-ukraine/) Members were given the choice of voluntarily moving to other units or move to Belaruse, which was ultimately the same choice but more circuitous. When Wagner were integrated into the Russian army, every assault-capable Russian force was ground down and portions of Wagner had just engaged in history's weirdest mutiny. There were various reasons Wagner was broken apart. So Wagner soldiers ended up all over. Many joined similar groups and there are example of veteran status being leveraged – placement also wasn't purely random. For example, the 'Kamerton' unit of the 'Akhmat Special Forces' somewhat recently fought around the flanks of Bakhmut and is reportedly mostly ex-Wagner. In Avdiivka, the 115th Special Brigade of the Rosgvardia was active, which included many former Wagnerites. There are examples of Wagner veterans of Bakhmut assault squads being given non-Wagner assault squad leadership like was seen in attacks around the Sand Quarry in Avdiivka. Other times, it's totally piecemeal. The Russian military obviously doesn't post its composition publicly, so this is sourced from Telegram channels. Take it with a grain of salt and know it's an anecdotal look at where these soldiers went post-Wagner ... and through a very opaque outside vantage.

So anyway, no more Wagner. But I think it's worth asking what about Wagner remains beyond the individuals scattered throughout the Russian armed forces. I would lump that response into three parts: 1) PMCs, 2) Wagner's recruiting methodologies, 3) The Wagner assault model as seen in Bakhmut, etc..

So, PMCs. Wagner was different from other PMCs – it may not be helpful to ask if there are other Wagners out there. Three things happened to make them special. 1) The Russian army failed to break through Ukrainian lines in the Donbas, 2) [Wagner succeeded in Popasna with a paltry 2,000 soldiers in May, 2022,](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/07/inside-the-wagner-uprising) and 3) Prigozhnin leveraged that success into a ""pitch"" of sorts: give me disposable people from prisons and I will repeat Popasna elsewhere. So Wagner was enlarged in Summer, 2022. [By June, 2022, Prigozhin was claiming 25,000 soldiers.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66005256) This was Prigozhin's bid to control a private army that could serve as the 'assault engine' of the Russian armed forces, creating breakthroughs and meeting strategic goals while regular Russian forces essentially held ground. This size, role, support were completely unique and not representative of Russian PMCs. The concept was then [tested at Bakhmut](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/25/wagner-chief-says-20000-of-its-troops-killed-in-bakhmut-battle) and resulted in the infamous kerfuffle of underperformance and MoD rivalries. Afterwards, there was a reshuffling of how PMCs relate to the invasion of Ukraine. They do exist after Prigozhin's death. For example, [a former Wagner commander founded a PMC named ""Convoy"".](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/03/26/armed-to-the-teeth) Gazprom (yeah, *that* Gazprom) has a PMC that's, on paper, supposed to defend gas interests, but now has a unit in Ukraine. But these units are relatively small and always subservient to the MoD. First, soldiers [now sign contracts with both the PMC and the MoD.](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-backs-push-mercenary-groups-sign-contracts-despite-wagners-refusal-2023-06-13/) Secondly, equipment and supplies are used as leverage over the groups. Finally, they are structured inside of larger Russian formations with limited autonomy. Redut Galaxy is a PMC living under the 1st Division in a recon role. Interestingly, they have responsibilities around recruitment at a higher level than they operate militarily – so much so that [RFE has called them a ""fake PMC"".](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-redut-fake-pmc/32651874.html) So we won't be seeing another Wagner in Ukraine, but Russia still sees value in PMCs: not only can it farm out recruitment, but PMC deaths are not counted, and their participation gives combat experience to PMCs that may have a role abroad, etc.. But for now, in Ukraine, PMCs are being tucked neatly under the MoD.

The Wagner recruitment model is clearly losing steam, though. Although Wagner advertised all over (on [Pornhub](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-pornhub-wagner-recruiting-ukraine-war/32321052.html) in [schools,](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/3/21/23622615/ukraine-war-bakhmut-wagner-group-russia) bilboards, etc.) the bulk of Wagner at its height and for its main purpose [came from prisons.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62911618) The low hanging fruit on that tree has obviously been picked – Russia isn't creating enough criminals who would like to go to Ukraine to keep pace with need, even though [the practice continues with the Russian army.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67175566)

The type of assault that Russia is leaning into (see: Avdiivka vs. Vuhledar) was popularized at Bakhmut. Russia is only able to effectively take land without catastrophic loss (in the immediate sense – there's discussion to be had about dwindling stockpiles of refurbishable equipment) is based on small group infantry ""reconnaissance in force"" assaults, with tanks, IFVs, etc. used for support rather than the traditional massed breaching role. Russia opens a single focused area of battle at a salient (e.g. Bakhmut, Avdiivka, now likely Robotyne) and it is hammered with indirect fire (now including glide bombs) while Russian infantry die in droves to eventually create a strategically-marginal, usually symbolic victory. Assuming the point is greater than symbolism, I would suggest that the hope is to create an unsustainable long-term situation for Ukraine's defenders, and/or create propaganda points for internal consumption (upcoming Russian ""election"") and external propaganda (wear down Ukrainian support). By all accounts, [Russia has no path to victory in the immediate future without Ukraine's foreign backing falling to pieces.](https://www.wsj.com/world/ukraines-military-spy-chief-says-russia-will-struggle-to-keep-up-the-fight-c6a5b2c5) But Russia is hammering on Ukraine's [manpower weaknesses,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/21/europe/ukraine-tough-choices-mobilization-intl-cmd/index.html) and ongoing ammunition shortages.

The linked article doesn't support this claim. In fact, it says:

> The Kremlin has denied it was behind the crash, rejecting widespread speculation that the it was a revenge assassination for Prigozhin’s short-lived mutiny in late June

So, you could find another source to support the widespread supposition that it was an assassination, or you could just leave out that part of the claim, since it's not entirely relevant to your question. It's your choice. [EDIT: There's a reference to assassination later in the submission that needs similar attention.]

It's difficult to say what has or hasn't been heard by people, especially in a global forum where claims require evidence. I suggest eliminating this.

The other premise about Africa is good, as are all the questions except the last one:

Please note that nowhere above did I request ""proof,"" 100% or otherwise, that ""Prigozhin was assassinated by Vladimir Putin."" I only asked that if you were going to leave the claim in, you provide a ""source to support the widespread supposition"" of such, because the included source did not.

* The GOP controls the majority, and therefore the speakership. The speaker sets the agenda and decides what bills to bring to the floor for a vote.
* Aside from a couple niche exceptions, that means the GOP has the power to only vote on bills it wants to pass — it's pretty rare to see a majority put up a bill they *don't* want to pass, unless they are absolutely sure it will fail anyway.

> Such divestment can be complicated when a university’s financial relationship to a targeted company is not direct but through an investment in an index fund.

Indeed, [index funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) are diversified, making them safe and extremely popular, but it would be possible for any well-educated investor to avoid them and make targeted investments instead. The issue comes up when any institution's investing guidelines mandate low risk investing with the highest possible yields. It's hard to beat index funds for that.

> “Divestment is a rallying cry that is nationally resonant,” said Nick Wilson, a 20-year-old Cornell student involved in the protests. “We don’t want our tuition dollars going to the research and development of weapons” that may be used against Gazans.

Is it tuition dollars or endowment dollars that are going towards these investments? My understanding is that tuition dollars get spent entirely on education. In a university like Harvard, tuition revenue doesn't even cover operating expenses and [the endowment has to make up the difference to the tune of 37%.](https://finance.harvard.edu/files/fad/files/fy23_harvard_financial_report.pdf) (PDF, page 6) It's less at Columbia, with [only 12% of the budget supported through the endowment,](https://www.columbia.edu/content/financial-overview) but even so, all the tuition dollars are spent on operating expenses. They're not going to investments.

> the most consistent demand is that the college institution divest the endowments from Israeli companies and institutions

My understanding is that the demand for divestment is complicated by the fact that
[38 states](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-bds-legislation) have [anti-BDS laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-BDS_laws#Anti-BDS_laws_in_the_United_States) on the books. The list includes not just states with Republican legislatures, but also Democratic strongholds like New York and California, where many of the protests are taking place. 

These laws have passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, so reversing them would be a monumental task for the protesters. But without achieving that, university administrators are often barred from making any moves towards divestment, even if they wanted to. 

In those cases, it's hard to see how the protesters' demands are reasonable or even well-informed, but perhaps I'm missing something.

The students are aware that the investments are part of the endowment and not taken from their tuition. Many universities acknowledge at the institutional level that their choice of investments ought to represent the values of the university as a place of learning populated by faculty and students, and have looked in the past to students to hear opinions on how to direct endowment funds. Some quotations from Brown University students' overview statement [Brown Divest Now](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3VLPCRi7qvMkdcWqj-2HPwR9C1Oq1uL/view):

> [Brown's Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Practices] served to represent and articulate the Brown community’s moral expectations when it comes to how our endowment is invested. (p.2)
> 
> “[Divestment] is a critically important and strong statement by the University community..."" (quotation from Brown President Ruth J. Simmons on a past decision to divest from Sudan in 2006; p.1)

The fundamental issue raised by the Brown protesters is that the university endowment's Advisory Committee already endorsed divestment in 2020. The current president rejected the committee report in 2021 and refused to bring it to the university corporation, which has been the cause of protests ever since. (p.37, footnote 9) A vote of 90% of graduate students and a supermajority of the student council have called on the corporation to implement the committee's decision. (p.22)

For Brown students, the objective of the encampment protest was simply to force the president and the corporation to agree to a vote. Last week, they reached such an agreement and dismantled their encampment.

My understanding is that tuition dollars get spent entirely on education.

This is complicated from the fact that money is fungible. On paper, it can be separated out into various inputs and outputs and trade certain money from one to the other. In practice, if an entity has a certain amount of money coming in (e.g., combined funds from tuition and endowment) and a certain amount of money going out, does it really make a difference which money comes from where?

NeutralPolitics_data,post_4,post_4_4,"I haven’t seen many concise arguments for why they are protesting at all. In fact my sister asked me the other day why students are randomly supporting a terrorist group. 

So real quick, the October 7 Hamas attack killed around 1,200 people and 253 people were taken hostage. This includes 764 civilians killed (36 children) while the remaining were Israeli military. 

https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/02/20/the-most-tragic-victims-in-the-israel-hamas-war-are-those-who-have-no-say-in-it/

Since October 7th, Israel has killed 34,535 Palestinians and there may be an additional 10,000 under rubble. This includes more than 11,000 women and 13,800 children. 

https://www.npr.org/2024/02/29/1234159514/gaza-death-toll-30000-palestinians-israel-hamas-war

So there is a huge mismatch between deaths of Israeli and Palestinians especially among women and children (36 Israeli children and 13,800 Palestinian children in 7 months, and counting) 

Additionally, Gaza is surrounded by a wall and the two borders crossings are closed. Israel has 1 border and has closed it (because war) and Egypt is worried about Hamas among refugees sneaking into Egypt and moving the Palestine/Israel problem and turning it into an Egypt/Israel problem if Hamas attacks Israel from Egypt. 

https://www.npr.org/2023/12/12/1218388766/egypt-israel-gaza-palestinians-hamas

So for now, the 2 million people in Gaza are stuck there. Women and children who would be refugees fleeing violence are instead part of the death count. 

Killing children is a war crime. The US gives Israel military aid which has people upset and I would argue is the root of the protests. 

Colleges invest their money in the stock market including companies currently profiting by the US support of Israel in this war. Students hope that by pressuring colleges to remove stocks/investment in these companies (divesting), they can make profiting from the war unprofitable for companies as their stocks dip. Colleges have a lot of wealth and power, and students hope to twist their university’s arm into divesting from companies like Boeing will pressure these companies to stop building weapons that may be used to kill Palestinian women and children. 

https://time.com/6974063/divestment-explained-campus-protest-israel/

There’s a whole host of unanswered questions for me, like why protest colleges and not the US government directly?  But I suppose colleges are smaller fish to debate and colleges like Brown are negotiating divestment with students as a direct response to the protests.

Jewish settlers began [arriving in Ottoman Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_and_Judaism_in_the_Land_of_Israel) a generation before the Nakba and the Palestinian national movement arose in response, initiating a persistent campaign against the Jews and the first large-scale riots, forcing many to evacuate. Maybe that was the start.

The current conflict is happening in the Gaza strip, which didn't even exist as a separate entity during the Nakba, so maybe the Suez crisis, which precipitated the 1967 war that separated Gaza, can be blamed as the start.

Or maybe it goes all the way back to the Muslim conquests of the 7th century or the Jewish-Roman wars of the 1st century that began a long period of violence, enslavement, expulsion, displacement, forced conversion, and forced migration against the local Jewish population.

We could pick dozens of points in history to be an originating event, which is why ""who started it"" gets us nowhere.

One aspect I've seen which is (or perhaps better stated, ""may be"") related to this question is that the president of an Iranian university had reportedly offered scholarships to students expelled over pro-Palestinian protests.

It's not impossible, but the protests are simultaneous across more than 50 campuses and are using many of the same tactics at the same time. There's also the fact that [half of those arrested at a couple of the campus protests were non-students.](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/04/1249188864/nyc-columbia-city-college-gaza-protests-palestinian-campus)

The Reuters article I linked in the submission says the [Students for Justice in Palestine](https://nationalsjp.org/) is one of the organizers of the protests and they have a map on their site of ""Gaza Solidarity Encampments"" at various universities. The group was [founded in 2001](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/education/edlife/middle-east-conflict-on-campus-anti-semitism.html) at the University of California, Berkeley, and has been promoting divestment policies since then. It didn't suddenly spring up in response to the current war. 

SJP certainly could have used the opportunity to further their cause, but there is [ample evidence](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/how-a-generation-is-being-politicized-on-palestine) they're organizing the protests, including by circulating a tool kit in the immediate aftermath of October 7th calling the Hamas attacks “a historic win for the Palestinian resistance.”

That same article includes unsubstantiated accusations that Hamas funds SJP. Attempts by at least [one other news organization to follow the money](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/s-palestinian-protests-us-rcna143666) have been relatively fruitless as well, so we really don't know how they're funded.",0,1,0.0258023697961817,0.0413900017738342,0.4997381269931793,0.0002404451370239,1,0

So I don't think it's particularly far out to suggest that Iran sees this as an opportunity to try to meddle with the 2024 election, or just to sow discord within the United States in general.

NeutralPolitics_data,post_4,post_4_14_2_2,"Between my initial comment and the subsequent replies, I think that the rationale for why one might suspect Iran could be interested in cultivating unrest in the USA has been established fairly well. This includes but is not limited to Iran trying to interfere or sow unrest in the USA previously. And also note that I made no claim of certainty that Iran \*created\* the protests. I explicitly and intentionally identified two potential avenues, one of which was Iran simply being reactive to take advantage of the situation and try to highlight the protests.

That doesn't mean it's proven for this case (nobody has claimed such), nor that anyone must agree with the thought, but I think it's sufficiently established as reasonable. As another example, a recent [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/business/media/campus-protests-russia-china-iran-us.html) discusses precisely this concept:

>As protests over the war in Gaza have spread across the United States, Russia, China and Iran have seized on them to score geopolitical points abroad and stoke tensions within the United States, according to researchers who have identified both overt and covert efforts by the countries to amplify the protests since they began.

And regarding possibilities of success, in the past the [FBI commented on ISIL/ISIS radicalizing westerners via online channels](https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/isil-online-countering-terrorist-radicalization-and-recruitment-on-the-internet-and-social-media-). And a [report by START at University of Maryland](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_PIRUS_UseOfSocialMediaByUSExtremists_ResearchBrief_July2018.pdf) (START is a research center concerning terrorism headquartered at UMD) discussed the use of social media for recruiting/radicalizing people. It has risen dramatically over the years. For example, figures 1 and 2 highlight that from 2003 - 2010, social media accounted for roughly 26 percent of radicalization, with 73% having no social media radicalization. From 2011-2016 that basically flipped, and only 27% had no social media radicalization, while for about 73% social media played a primary or secondary role.

So I don't think it's unreasonable to consider that Iran might be able to run online campaigns to encourage unrest or protests. Again, not proven, but proof-of-concept is there, rationale is there, and past history is there. I don't think this is really a stretch.",0,1,0.0249482402740291,0.033844769001007,0.4997543692588806,0.0078068077564239,1,0

I don't think this is true.  The Taliban have forced a 95% reduction in opium poppy cultivation -- if they can stamp it out almost entirely, they would find it much easier to tax it.

https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2023/November/afghanistan-opium-cultivation-in-2023-declined-95-per-cent-following-drug-ban_-new-unodc-survey.html

> Opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan plunged by an estimated 95 per cent following a drug ban imposed by the de facto authorities in April 2022, according to a new research brief from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  

> UN officials noted that the near-total contraction of the opiate economy is expected to have far-reaching consequences and highlighted the urgent need for enhanced assistance for rural communities, accompanied by alternative development support to build an opium-free future for the people of Afghanistan.  

> Opium cultivation fell across all parts of the country, from 233,000 hectares to just 10,800 hectares in 2023. The decrease has led to a corresponding 95 per cent drop in the supply of opium, from 6,200 tons in 2022 to just 333 tons in 2023.

And it sounds like there's quite an arbitrage available here.  If they lost $1 billion/year in revenue, a lot of money that could be converted to taxes -- even at an aggressive 50% tax on the excess profit, that would be $500m in the Taliban's coffers.

> Many farmers turned to cultivating wheat instead, with an overall increase of 160,000 hectares in cereal cultivation across the Farah, Hilmand, Kandahar, and Nangahar provinces. Though wheat cultivation may alleviate food insecurity to some extent, the crop generates much less income than opium – farmers in the four provinces lost around US$ 1 billion in potential income in 2023 by switching to wheat.",0,1,0.0286942410740285,0.1976014971733093,0.4997390210628509,7.18235969543457e-05,1,1

It all fundamentally and seriously changed when we got in college. 

My friend saw the marxists there and - I'll use his phrasing - ""what kind of people they associate themselves with"". He basically turned, to say it once more in his words, an ""anti-woke"" Marxist. When we met with each other and spoke about politics, I always pointed at the contradictio in terminis and now he's slowly moving toward the centre-left. 

I, myself, pulled more toward the rightwing. I was originally a neoliberal but slowly evolved, by becoming more and more aware of certain fields, to the rightwing. I'll be the first to admit I flirted with the radical right. Was it truly my opinion? No. Was it me trying to shock others? You may bet your ass. I become more moderate when I entered college, having to discuss what I think and people that would question what I said. It was a rough/rude awakening, but necessary. 

It firmly dragged me from populism and radicalism, and toward what I am now: a conservative. I would place myself between the centre-right and rightwing, but I have rejected 1) populism and 2) radicalism. 

 My other friends went the same route as me: They went from neoliberalism to conservatism in varying degrees. The radical right never gained as much ground with them, as they weren't exploring politics as much as I did.

Quite possibly yes, but that's not the alternative being prescribed in the article.

AskALiberal_data,post_3,post_3_0,"The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.

I was just wondering what kind of vision liberal voters had for universal healthcare in the US. More specifically how broad would coverage be, and what medical procedures/medicine might not be covered? Would it just follow similar guidelines as current private healthcare coverage or would it cover all medical care one might have, regardless of “necessity”. 

Just to give examples: 

Ozempic- Currently most private insurance companies only cover the medicine if it is prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It is (typically) not covered when prescribed off label as a weight loss drug. Would a universal healthcare system cover the cost of such a drug?

Cosmetic surgeries - insurance companies cover plastic surgeries when it is required due to illness or an accident. Ie. If a breast cancer patient has a mastectomy, insurance will cover the cost of breast implants. Meanwhile elective plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons is almost always paid for out of pocket. Would this remain the case under universal insurance?

Also what about gender affirming care? I know currently most insurance covers trans related healthcare, but this often requires a gender dysphoria diagnosis/letter of recommendation from a doctor. But how do it apply to cis individuals? I saw a Reddit post once talking about how balding is an example of gender dysphoria in cis individuals, I actually really liked the comparison and found it informative, but would something like hair implants be covered for cis individuals? Would they only be covered for women due to societal standards? 

I am genuinely curious how universal healthcare would decide what is and isn’t covered, because while I think it’s a more reasonable to fear limited coverage, on the other hand too broad of coverage seems susceptible to abuse and overspending.

Think Medicare, but covering everyone.

Like current Medicare, you would be able to get Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medicare advantage (if you wanted that for some reason). The tax-funded, universal component would cover essential care for everyone—you would have the option to buy additional supplemental insurance (ex. Privately, or through an employer) to cover additional things the base insurance doesn’t cover. Billing and payment and such would all follow through the same backend system to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort, even for supplemental coverage. 

HHS (in conjunction with relevant legislation and possibly the courts) would make determinations on what to cover, when to cover it, how much to cover, etc. 

> Would a universal healthcare system cover the cost of such a drug?

For its on-label uses.

> Would this remain the case under universal insurance?

Seems like the sort of thing to let the system and relevant experts sort out—where the line between medically necessary care for quality of life and vanity lies.

> Also what about gender affirming care?

That should be covered as medically necessary, and would be covered under the sort of society which would create a universal healthcare system.

AskALiberal_data,post_5,post_5_9,"Interesting question.

I think it would be very difficult to make the claim that lack of education, ignorance, or even stupidity are the key factor that makes people support right wing policies and politicians in the US. From what I can see, especially over the last 20 year or so, the key motivating factor for Americans on the right is anger, dissatisfaction, and maybe even spite. Sure, poor education contributes to those feelings, but I dont think it is causal. Additionally, I think people on the left need to acknowledge that in some key ways, the anger that motivates people on the right is justifiable, even if we profoundly disagree on the cause of that anger or how to fix it. 

Personally, I don't see access to education, in this context, as all that difference than access to any other resource, like healthcare, social saftey nets, and/or affordable housing. My reading of the current climate is that right wingers are primarily upset due to difficulties with accessing these resources, perceptions that they face difficulties to accessing these resources, and believing that their access to these resources is being threatened by outsiders.

So, with this in mind, I do think better access to education would make the right significantly different. Not because they would become smart enough to change their views, but that the anger they feel would be diminished and replaced with a degree of civic pride/enthusiasm. Similarly, I would apply that same logic to accessing any vital resource.  

This is where I think the Democratic party has failed. They are failing to really improve access to resources in the communities where right wingers typically live. Additionally, in some cases, they dont do a good enough job at making sure these communities understand that it is Democratic policy that is giving them access. This is a big reason why I am a communist. We cant lecture the right wing into abandoning their position. We need to actually deliver what they need, where they are at. Once that is done and we can improve their material conditions in a measurable way, we can bring them back from the current wave of reactionary thinking.

Finally, I understand that in many ways it is right wing policy which is destroying their access to resources. I have worked in health care and public schooling for the last 10 years and I find it equal parts frustrating and amusing when right wing families (and they often like to tell everyone just how right wing they are) complain about the horrible state of the systems which their policies destroyed. However, rubbing their noses in it utterly fails to win them over, and infact just makes them more angry, perpetuating the cycle. I am not sure if the cycle is intentional, but if right wing politics and media intentionally built this cycle, it is pretty brilliant.",0,1,0.0381920662429136,0.0161981582641601,0.4997627735137939,0.0008684694766998,0,1

Its why Kamela Khan was an Inhuman (though now they've hilariously retconned that either she's a mutant or both), and why in the shows they were setting up stories that were carbon copy mutant stories just as ""inhumans"" instead. 

Funnily enough, since 2019, Inhumans have basically vanished from the comics. I think Black Bolt has had less than 5 appearences since 2019, and he's one of the most important characters in the Marvel world.

I would say that it wasn't necessarily regret, more so an understandable sacrifice. For example, we didn't have time to implement a true fog of war system because we had other elements (combat, enemy AI, etc.) that would  give the player a better experience overall. There was a few of those, hah! 

One element that did get cut that didn't make sense was that the player could flip between 4 masks (Maskless counted as a masked state to a degree). When playing it over and over, it didn't make sense so we went down to 2 masks.

I would say the biggest advice I can give is to find the time to just do it. Start slowly and just start somewhere. Zau started with the idea of depicting grief and with the character. The level design element started with me drawing on paper. If you can get the ball rolling, you'll find those finer details the deeper you get into it. It's just about giving yourself that small push. Pirate Software is a great person to listen to in regards to just getting into making games!

For example, we recorded all of Tales of Kenzera's dialogue in two weeks. We then implemented it in game, realised some bits didn't make sense, and needed to do an additional week of pick ups.
