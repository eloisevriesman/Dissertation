science,post_1,post_1_1,"I’ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: 

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976241243370

From the linked article: 

A recent study published in Psychological Science has found that people with diverse social networks, comprising both similar and different individuals, tend to report higher social cohesion in their neighborhoods and, in turn, higher levels of well-being. The findings suggest that while people naturally tend to form bonds with those who are similar to them, integrating more diverse social networks yields significant social and personal benefits.

Previous research has shown that contact with people from various groups can reduce prejudice and enhance social outcomes. However, debates persist, with some arguing that diversity might reduce trust and social cohesion. This study aimed to clarify these conflicting views by exploring how the composition of one’s social network — specifically the balance between similar (homophilous) and different (heterophilous) friends — affects perceived social cohesion and subjective well-being.

The researchers used data from Understanding Society – the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), which has surveyed around 40,000 households since 2009. This nationally representative survey includes detailed information on demographics, socioeconomic status, health, social life, and attitudes. The study focused on data from two waves, collected between 2011-2013 and 2014-2016, specifically analyzing responses from 24,726 individuals in 10,398 English neighborhoods.

The study examined four types of social network homophily: race, age, income, and education. Respondents were asked to report the proportion of their friends who were similar to them in each of these aspects. Social cohesion was measured using a neighborhood cohesion instrument, which assessed individuals’ sense of community, attraction to their neighborhood, and interactions with neighbors.

The researchers found an inverted U-shaped relationship between network homophily and social cohesion. Initially, as the proportion of similar friends increases, social cohesion also increases, peaking at a midpoint. Beyond this point, however, further increases in similarity within social networks begin to reduce social cohesion. The inverted U-shaped pattern held true across different types of homophily (race, age, income, and education).

In other words, a moderate level of homophily — where social networks include a balanced mix of similar and different individuals — appears to promote the greatest sense of community and connection among neighbors. This social cohesion, in turn, is strongly associated with increased overall life satisfaction and better mental health.",0,1,0.0276397011802252,0.0311150550842285,0.4996804893016815,0.1176669895648956,0,1

>The usual way of manufacturing synthetic diamonds involves applying huge pressures to carbon at high temperatures. Now, however, researchers at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Korea have shown that while high temperatures are still a prerequisite, it is possible to make polycrystalline diamond film at standard pressures. The new technique could revolutionize diamond manufacturing, they say.
>
>Natural diamonds form over billions of years in the Earth’s upper mantle at temperatures of between 900 and 1400 °C and pressures of 5–6 gigapascals (GPa). For the most part, the manufacturing processes used to make most synthetic diamonds mimic these conditions. In the 1950s, for example, scientists at General Electric in the US developed a way to synthesize diamonds in the laboratory using molten iron sulphide at around 7 GPa and 1600 °C. Although other researchers have since refined this technique (and developed an alternative known as chemical vapour deposition for making high-quality diamonds), diamond manufacturing largely still depends on liquid metals at high pressures and temperatures (HPHT).
>
>A team led by Rodney Ruoff has now turned this convention on its head by making a polycrystalline diamond film using liquid metal at just 1 atmosphere of pressure and 1025 °C. When Ruoff and colleagues exposed a liquid alloy of gallium, iron, silicon and nickel to a mix of methane and hydrogen, they observed diamond growing in the subsurface of the liquid metal. The team attribute this effect to the catalytic activation of methane and the diffusion of carbons atoms in the subsurface region.

[Growth of diamond in liquid metal at 1 atm pressure](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07339-7)

Abstract:

>Natural diamonds were (and are) formed (thousands of million years ago) in the upper mantle of Earth in metallic melts at temperatures of 900–1,400 °C and at pressures of 5–6 GPa. Diamond is thermodynamically stable under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions as per the phase diagram of carbon. Scientists at General Electric invented and used a high-pressure and high-temperature apparatus in 1955 to synthesize diamonds by using molten iron sulfide at about 7 GPa and 1,600 °C. There is an existing model that diamond can be grown using liquid metals only at both high pressure and high temperature. Here we describe the growth of diamond crystals and polycrystalline diamond films with no seed particles using liquid metal but at 1 atm pressure and at 1,025 °C, breaking this pattern. Diamond grew in the subsurface of liquid metal composed of gallium, iron, nickel and silicon, by catalytic activation of methane and diffusion of carbon atoms into and within the subsurface regions. We found that the supersaturation of carbon in the liquid metal subsurface leads to the nucleation and growth of diamonds, with Si playing an important part in stabilizing tetravalently bonded carbon clusters that play a part in nucleation. Growth of (metastable) diamond in liquid metal at moderate temperature and 1 atm pressure opens many possibilities for further basic science studies and for the scaling of this type of growth.",0,1,0.0243443004966892,0.5522491931915283,0.4996274411678314,0.8918968737125397,0,1

To deliver this deep brain stimulation (DBS), electrodes are implanted in areas of the brain through small holes drilled in the skull. A pacemaker-like device is also inserted under the skin of the chest to power the electrodes.

Inserting electrodes into the brain has risks, one being that the leads carrying those electrodes can be misplaced, migrate, or break. Researchers from the Uhlan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), South Korea, have developed a biodegradable, wirelessly activated ‘bio-paper’ implant that avoids these issues.

science,post_12,post_12_2,"Water scarcity will intensify with climate and socioeconomic change, disproportionately impacting populations located in the Global South. So concludes a new Utrecht University article published in Nature Climate Change on 23 May 2024, which used a state-of-the-art global water quantity and quality model to estimate clean water scarcity until the end of the century.

Humans require clean water for drinking and sanitation purposes, but also for the production of food, energy and manufactured goods. As communities and policymakers grapple with water scarcity issues on the ground, researchers at Utrecht University aim to shed light on the escalating global clean water crisis.

Current and future water scarcity
Using simulations from a state-of-the-art water quantity and quality model, the authors assess present-day and future global water scarcity. ""Climate change and socioeconomic developments have multi-faceted impacts on the availability and quality of, and demands for, water resources in the future,"" says lead author Dr. Edward Jones. ""Changes in these three aspects are crucial for evaluating future water scarcity.""

The study estimates that 55% of the global population currently lives in areas that experience a lack of clean water in at least one month per year. ""By the end of the century, this may be as high as 66%,"" remarks Jones.
